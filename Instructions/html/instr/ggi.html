    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will make a decision <b>about how much money you are willing to give up to help   other participants.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        You will <b>be given 100 points and be matched with a group of N other participants</b> who also begin with 100 points each.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each point is worth <b>a 10 cent bonus payment</b> at the end of the experiment. 
    </li>
    <li>
        At the beginning of the experiment, there is a 90% chance that the participants you are grouped with will <b>all lose all of their points</b> before they are paid.  However, for every point you spend to help these other participants, <b>this percentage will go down by one percentage point.  </b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For instance, if you spend one point, the percentage chance all of the participants lose their points goes down to 89%;  if you spend 50 points it will go down to 40%;  if you spend 90 points it will go down to 0%.  
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Regardless, you are at no risk of losing your points except to the extent you spend points to help.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>how many participants are at risk of losing their bonus.</b> You will then decide how many points you would like to spend to help them, by reducing their chance of losing their bonus.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also spend fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds   of this task. Across these rounds, the value of N varies.    These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study will affect your bonus and the bonus payments of other participants in your group.  Everyone from your group is making the <b>same decision you are</b>.  If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the computer will <b>randomly pick one person from your group whose decision will “count.”</b> This person will receive their  <b>initial points minus the number of points they decided to spend to help for sure.</b>     Everyone else from the group will then randomly lose their bonus with a chance that depends on the decision of the person whose decisions was selected to count.   Since your decision only matters if your decision was selected to count, it is best to make this decision as if you are this person.

        <li>
            In this example, there are 4 other people in your group whose bonus is at risk.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to type into the box the number (between 0 and 90) of points you would like to spend to help the other people in your group.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points you would like to spend to help. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.   
    </li>
