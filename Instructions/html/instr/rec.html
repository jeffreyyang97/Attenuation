    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you have to estimate the stock price of a fictional company. </b>   
    <ul>
    <li>
        The stock price is determined by the number of good and bad pieces of news about the company.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, there are 10 pieces of news about each company. The stock price is determined by the following formula:
        <center>
            <div class="formula_li">
                Stock price = 100 + 10 &#x2715; number of positive news – 10 &#x2715; number negative news
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the number of pieces of positive and negative news.</b> You will then guess the stock price.
    </li>
    <li>
        Across these rounds, the number of pieces of positive and negative news received will vary. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In the second section of the task, there will be another 13 rounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</div>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in the first or second section of this part is selected for payment, your guess of the stock price determines the bonus:
    <center>
        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = 10 – 1/1000 &#x2715; (your guess - stock price) &#x2715; (your guess - stock price)
        </div>
    </center>
    While this formula might look complicated, all this means is that you should <b>provide your best guess of the actual stock price for each company.</b>

            In this example, the company has received 3 pieces of positive news and 7 pieces of negative news. 
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to guess the stock price.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will make your guess of the stock price. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that your guess is correct.
       </li>
