<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>guess a secretly drawn number based on advice from another participant who will partly be paid to make you guess as high as possible.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The computer randomly <b>draws a “secret number” between 0 and 100 with equal probability.</b> This means that each of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on all the way up to 100 are equally likely to come up. You will not see which secret number was drawn. You receive more money the more accurately you guess, i.e. the closer your guess is to the secret number:

            </li>
            <li>
                Before making your guess, you will receive a message from another participant. This other participant does not guess the secret number like you do. Rather, <b>the other participant sees the secret number and then chooses which number to report to you.  </b>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        The other participant <b>can report the actual secret number to you or a different one.</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The other participant’s bonus depends on the number you guess. The other participant's total bonus consists of two parts: a  <b>High-Guess Bonus</b> and an <b>Accuracy Bonus</b>.
                <center>
                    <div class="formula">
                        Other participant’s total bonus = <b>X</b>% of High-Guess Bonus + (100 - <b>X</b>)% of Accuracy Bonus
                    </div>
                </center>
                
                </li>
                <li>
                    	These two bonuses both depend on your guess, but in different ways:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>High-Guess Bonus:</b> this bonus is determined by how high your guess is, i.e. <b>the other participant gets paid more if your guess is higher, independent of what the secret number is.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Accuracy Bonus:</b> just like your bonus, this bonus is also determined by how accurate your guess is (how close your guess is to the secret number)
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case you’re interested in how exactly the Accuracy and High-Guess Bonuses are calculated, please

                Across rounds in this study, sometimes the other participant’s total bonus will mostly be determined by the High-Guess Bonus and sometimes mostly by the Accuracy Bonus. For example, it may be that the other participant receives 90% of the High-Guess Bonus and 10% of the Accuracy Bonus, or that they receive 30% of the High-Guess Bonus and 70% of the Accuracy Bonus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The higher the share of the High-Guess bonus, the more the other participant benefits from you guessing something high, rather than you guessing accurately.</b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For example, when the other participant receives 100% of the High-Guess Bonus (and 0% of the Accuracy Bonus), your interests are completely misaligned: their earnings will only depend on how high your guess is.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    The higher the share of the Accuracy Bonus, the more the other participant benefits from you guessing accurately.
                </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For example, when the other participant receives 0% of the High-Guess Bonus (and 100% of the Accuracy Bonus), then they get paid in exactly the same way as you are. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                In each round, you will be told both the other participant’s bonus shares and which number they report to you. Then you will make your guess. When choosing which number to report to you, the other participant knows that you know what their bonus shares are.
            </li>
            <li>
                In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the other participant’s bonus shares will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

    Your decisions may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you will receive a bonus payment determined by the accuracy of your guess as described above:

        </li>
        <li>
            You then then make your guess by picking a number between 0 and 100.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:

       <li>
        	You will state what you think is the secret number.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible decision given the information available to you.
