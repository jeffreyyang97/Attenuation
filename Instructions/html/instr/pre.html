    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will <b>decide between a lottery ticket and a safe payment.</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        A lottery ticket pays <b>$18 with some percentage chance, and $0 otherwise.</b> 
    </li>
    <li>
        A safe payment is paid with certainty.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the amount of the safe payment.</b> You will then decide between the safe payment and lottery tickets with different percentage chances of paying $18.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the safe payment will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, the computer will randomly select one of your choices.    <ul>
        <li>
            If you picked the lottery, you will receive the outcome of the lottery, implemented by the computer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If you picked the safe payment, you will receive that payment.
        </li>
    </ul>
    This means that it is in your best interest to  <b>choose the option (lottery or safe payment) you actually prefer in each case. </b>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the safe payment is $15.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether your prefer this safe payment or a lottery ticket with a specific percentage chance of winning $18.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see choice lists such as the one below, where each row is a separate choice.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

</center>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        In every list, the right-hand option (Option B) is a safe payment that is identical in all rows. The left-hand option (Option A) is a lottery ticket. The percentage chance of the lottery ticket paying &18 increases as you go down the list. 
    </li>
    <li>
        To make a choice just click on the option you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row), <span style="background-color: lightyellow;">highlighting your choice yellow. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing Option A to choosing Option B.</b> You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting Option A in all rows above and Option B in all rays below your selected row.
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on where you switch from Option A to Option B in this list, we assess which percentage chance of winning $18 (Option A) you value as much as the safe payment (Option B). 
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, in the choice list above, you would value the safe payment as much as a lottery ticket that pays $18 with a percentage chance between 85% and 100% because this is where switching occurs.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between a safe payment and different lottery tickets. We will use these decisions to assess which winning probability you value as much as the safe payment. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect which winning probability you value as much as the safe payment, given your personal preferences and the available information.
    </li>
