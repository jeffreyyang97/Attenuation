    <br>
        In this part of the study, you will <b>act as a fictional consumer.</b> Your task is to maximize the consumer's happiness by deciding <b>how much of a fictional healthy drink to purchase:</b> between 0 and 100 gallons for a given year.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consuming the drink generates both higher happiness through improved health and lower happiness because of costs for the consumer.
            </li>
        <li>
            <u>Health:</u> The consumer derives health from consuming the drink according to the following figure and  equation
        </li>

            <div>
                <b>
                    Health = Gallons bought  &#x2715; (200 - Gallons bought)
                </b>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <li>
        As you can see in the figure, your health increases in how much you consume. <b>It is always true that the more of the drink you consume the healthier you are.</b> However, <b>each additional gallon produces less and less additional health.</b> For example, while the health derived from 10 gallons is higher than the health derived from 9 gallons, the additional health derived from the one additional gallon is much smaller than the additional health that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Costs:</u> You need to pay a price for each gallon you consume.
    </li>
    <center>
        <div class="formula_li">
            <b>
                Costs = Price per gallon (in Dollars) &#x2715; Gallons bought
            </b>
        </div>
    </center>
    <li>
        <u>Total happiness:</u> The consumer’s total happiness is then given by:
    </li>
    <center>
        <div class="formula_li">
            <b>
                Total happiness = Health – Costs =</b>
            <br>
            <b>
                Gallons consumed &#x2715; (200 - Gallons consumed) - Price per gallon &#x2715; Gallons consumed
            </b>        
</div>
    </center>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the price of each gallon of the healthy drink.</b> You will then decide how much to consume.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, <b>the cost of the drink varies.</b> These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer the consumer’s total happiness is to the maximum possible total happiness, the higher your bonus will be:
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10 - 1/1,000 &#x2715; (Maximum attainable total happiness – Consumer’s actual total happiness) 
            </div>
        </center>
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by truthfully <b>telling us how many gallons of the drink you think maximize the total happiness of the fictional consumer.</b></div>

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much of the drink you consume.
        </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.   
    </li>
   </ul>
