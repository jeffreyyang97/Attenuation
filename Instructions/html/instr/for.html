    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>your task is to forecast the future stock price growth of several fictional firms, based on the current earnings of each firm.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        There are <b>two types</b> of firms: <b>Good</b> firms and <b>Bad</b> <b>firms</b>. Good firms have an <b>average stock price growth of</b> <b>$50</b>, while <b>Bad firms have an average stock price growth of $10.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Because these numbers are averages, it is possible for a firm to deliver a stock price growth above or below the average.
        </li>
        <li>
            The graphic below plots the likelihood of each level of stock price growth for the two types of firms:

                            60 Good firms

    <li>
        Each firm you forecast will be randomly drawn from a group of 100 firms, of which 60 are Good and 40 are Bad. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Good firms are <b>more</b> than 50% likely to be large, and 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bad firms are <b>less</b> than 50% likely to be large.
            </li>
            <li>
                The exact likelihood that Good vs. Bad firms are large will vary from round to round. For each firm you forecast, you will be told these probabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The future increase in the stock price depends only on whether the firm is Good or Bad and not directly on its size.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be asked to forecast the stock growth of a different firm.  To help you make your forecast, we will tell you whether the firm is large and the likelihood that Good vs. Bad firms are large.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of the task.  Across these rounds, the likelihood Good vs. Bad firms are large will vary.  These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. 
    For each round, there will be a statistically correct forecast of the stock price growth of the firm. 
    If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you will recieve $10 if your answer is within +/- $1 of the statistically correct forecast, and nothing otherwise.

            In this example, the probability that good firms have high earnings is 10%.

        <li>
            You then need to give your forecast of the stock price growth of this firm.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will forecast the stock price growth of the firm.     
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your forecast is actually the statistically correct forecast.
