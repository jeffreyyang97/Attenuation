<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>guess whether a coin toss came up Heads or Tails after getting advice from another participant.</b> This other participant may try to get you to guess that the coin came up Heads.
        <ul>
    <li>
        The computer tosses a coin that comes up Heads or Tails with equal probability. Your task is to allocate <b>100 points between “Heads” and “Tails” to indicate how likely you think it is the coin came up Heads or Tails.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>more</b> points you allocate to the actual outcome, the <b>higher your bonus earnings will be, on average.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Before allocating your points, you may receive a message from another participant. 
        This other participant <b>sees the outcome of the coin toss</b> and <b>chooses between revealing this information to you and not revealing it.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the participant chooses <b>Reveal</b>, you will be told the outcome of the coin toss. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If the participant chooses to <b>Not Reveal</b>, you will not get any message. 
            </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The other participant’s decision about whether or not to reveal may be influenced by how they get paid: for each point that you allocate to “Heads”, they get an amount <span style="color: blue;">$x</span>.</b>
        We call this number x the “<b>bonus multiplier</b>.”
        <ul>
            <li>
                For example: if you allocate 70 points to “Heads” and the bonus multiplier is 6 cents, the other participant gets 70 &#x2715; $0.06 = $4.20.
            </li>
            <li>
                This means: The <b>higher</b> the bonus multiplier, the <b>more the other participant benefits from you allocating points to “Heads”.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                When choosing to Reveal or Not Reveal, <b>the other participant knows that you know how their bonus is determined.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the other participant’s bonus multiplier before you allocate your points.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also guess fractions, such as 6.78 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever the other participant chooses Reveal, <b>you will know the outcome of the coin toss, and hence your decision is straightforward.</b> We will not ask you for your decision in those rounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Instead, we will only ask for <b>your decision in rounds in which the other participant decides to Not Reveal.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the other participant’s bonus multiplier will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, you may win a bonus of $10. Your chances of winning that bonus depend on whether a round with or without a message gets selected.
   <ul>
        <li>
            <b>If round with message selected:</b> This means the other participant decided to Reveal. In this scenario, you will win the $10 with certainty. Recall that we will simply skip these rounds when asking about your decision.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If round without message selected:</b> 
            This means that the other participant chose to Not Reveal. These are the 11 rounds in which we ask for your guesses. In this case, your chance of winning the $10 bonus is given by how many points you allocate to the correct outcome. If you’re interested, you can

        You will allocate 100 points to express how likely you think it is the coin came up Heads.

        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible decision given the information available to you.
