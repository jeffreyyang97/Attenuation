    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
        In this part of the study, <b>you will play against another participant. You will choose an action ‘Top’ or ‘Bottom’. </b> You will be matched to <b>another participant in the study who will also choose ‘Left’ or ‘Right’.</b>  The combinations of your two actions will determine each of your payments.    
    <ul>
    <li>
        Your earnings from your and your counterpart’s choice will be shown in a payoff matrix like this one:
        <center>
            <img style="width: 450px;" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_KeENaBP7HjWNEp2" alt="">
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your choice determines the row of the matrix determining the payments (top row or bottom row);  your counterpart’s choice determines the column of the matrix (left column or right column).  <b>Together they determine which one cell of the matrix determines both of your payments.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                In each cell of the table (each combination of your and your counterpart’s choices), the <b>first number (shown in blue) gives the amount you would earn</b> and <b>the second number (shown in red) the amount your counterpart would earn.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                The amount '<u><b>X</b></u>', i.e. the payment that occurs if you choose Top and your counterpart Left,<b> will vary from round to round in the task.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you (and your counterpart) will be told X.   You will then each choose an action, which will determine your payment according to the payoff matrix.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the payment X varies.   These rounds are completely independent from one another.  If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment.  If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you and your matched counterpart will earn the amounts in the matrix shown above that corresponds to your and your counterpart’s choices.

            In the example above, X is equal to $3.50.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether to choose action Top or Bottom.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will choose action Top or Bottom.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the best decision you can take for yourself, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
   </ul>
