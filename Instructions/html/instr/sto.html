    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will be asked 
<b>to forecast the U.S. stock market over different time horizons.</b><ul>
    <li>
        By “U.S. stock market” we mean the S&P 500 index that calculates the average stock market performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell <b>you what the time horizon is.</b> You will then be asked to forecast the value of a $100 investment into the stock market over this horizon.  
    </li>

    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the time horizon varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>

        <li>
            In this example, the time horizon is 10 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to forecast the value of a $100 investment into the stock market after 10 months.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
    <li>
        Your forecast of the stock market.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible forecast, given the information you have today.   
    </li>
   </ul>
