    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be asked to <b>estimate the weight of a bucket.</b> You will not get to see the bucket yourself. Rather,<b> you will have to rely on the estimates of others.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        There are two different types of people: <b>2 Communicators</b> and <b>100 Estimators. </b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>Communicators</b> are called <b style="color: red;">Ann</b> and <b style="color: blue;">Bob</b>. Neither of them gets to see the bucket, either. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Estimators</b>, on the other hand, have all <b>independently seen the bucket and are all equally good at estimating its weight.</b> Each estimator produces their own estimate of the weight of the bucket. <b>The actual weight of the bucket is the average of these 100 estimates.</b> 
            </li>
            <li>
                Each of the 100 Estimators transmits their individual estimate either to Ann or to Bob. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ann and Bob <b>compute the average of the estimates they observe,</b> and then communicate the averages to you. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, Ann and Bob report these two averages to you. You will also be told <b>how many Estimators reported their estimates to Ann and to Bob,</b> respectively. Based on what you find out from Ann and Bob, your task is to <b>estimate the weight of the bucket.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Estimators reporting to Ann and Bob as well as their estimates vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. For each round, there is a correct answer for the weight of the bucket. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer your decision is to the correct weight, the higher your bonus will be: 
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10 - 1/640 &#x2715; (Your decision - correct answer) &#x2715; (Your decision - correct answer) 
            </div>
        </center>
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you <b>maximize your bonus by truthfully telling us what you think the weight of the bucket is. </b>

        <li>
            You would then give your estimate of the weight of the bucket in pounds, based on the information provided.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will estimate the weight of the bucket. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are that your estimate is actually correct. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your estimate is correct.
       </li>
