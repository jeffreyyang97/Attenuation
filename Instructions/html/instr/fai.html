    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you will decide how to distribute rewards from a contest between two other participants.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        We ask two participants to participate in a contest.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The goal of participants is <b>to translate as many sequences of letters into numbers as possible in two minutes</b> (e.g. P is 390, H is 769, Y is 734 etc.).
                <center>
                    <img style="width: 400px" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_KIjCYBEwZtUgMHb" alt="">
                </center>
            </li>
            <li>
                The winner of the contest is determined in two possible ways, based on performance or based on random luck:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    With some percentage chance, <b>the winner is selected to be whichever participant translated the most sequences</b> in two minutes.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the remaining percentage chance, <b>the computer declares the winner by flipping a digital coin</b> (meaning each player wins with 50% chance).
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>   
    </li>
    <li>
        Whoever is declared by the computer to be <b>the winner of the contest will be given 100 points</b> (each point is worth 10 cents to these previous participants).   </li>
    <li>
        Your job in the experiment is to decide <b>how many of the points given to the declared winner of the contest you would like to transfer to the declared loser.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be matched with a different pair of other participants, and <b>told the percentage chance that the computer declares the winner based on the outcome of the contest instead of a coin flip.</b>   You will <b>then decide how many points to transfer from the declared winner to the declared loser.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also transfer fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the pair of participants and the percentage chance that the winner is declared based on their performance in the contest varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to “count”, only your decision in this one round will determine the bonuses of these previous participants.
    </li>
</ul>

    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect the bonus payment of previous participants. If a decision in this part is selected to count, your decision on how to transfer points will determine their bonuses.

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, there is a 50%  chance the declared winner, who will be awarded 100 points, wins due to their performance in the task rather than due to the outcome of a coin flip.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how many points from the declared winner to the declared loser.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points will you transfer from the declared winner to the declared loser.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
