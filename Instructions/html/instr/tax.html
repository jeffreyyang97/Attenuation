    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will estimate the income taxes owed by a hypothetical taxpayer named Fred.  </b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Fred’s income is subject to two taxes: a <b>federal tax</b> and <b>a state tax.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The federal income tax contains 5 tax brackets:
        <center>
            <table class="table">
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="th">Federal Tax Rate</td>
                    <td class="th">Income Bracket</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">12%</td>
                    <td class="td">$0 to $20,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">18%</td>
                    <td class="td">$20,000 to $50,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">26%</td>
                    <td class="td">$50,000 to $80,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">32%</td>
                    <td class="td">$80,000 to $120,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">42%</td>
                    <td class="td">$120,000 and above</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        The state income tax contains 3 tax brackets:
        <center>
            <table class="table">
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="th">State Tax Rate</td>
                    <td class="th">Income Bracket</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">3%</td>
                    <td class="td">$0 to $30,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">7%</td>
                    <td class="td">$30,000 to $70,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="tr">
                    <td class="td">10%</td>
                    <td class="td">$70,000 and above</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
            These brackets work just as actual U.S. tax brackets do. Specifically, when Fred’s income jumps to a higher tax bracket, he doesn't pay the higher rate on his entire income. <b>He pays the higher rate only on the portion of his income that's in the new tax bracket.</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For instance, if Fred’s income is $35,000, he would pay federal taxes equal to 12% on the $20,000 portion of his income in the first bracket, plus 18% on the $15,000 portion of his income in the second bracket. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Similarly, in the scenario above Fred would pay state taxes equal to 3% on the $30,000 portion of his income in the first bracket, plus 7% on the $5,000 portion of his income in the second bracket. 
                </li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will ask you to estimate the total income tax <b>(state plus federal)</b> that Fred would have to pay for different levels of income.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the income of Fred varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

            In this example, Fred’s income is $65,000.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to estimate how much Fred would have to pay in total income taxes (state income taxes plus federal income taxes).

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:

   <ul>
       <li>
        	You will estimate how much Fred would have to pay in total income taxes. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your answer. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your answer is actually correct.
