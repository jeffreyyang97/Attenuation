    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will estimate <b>the value of a savings account that currently contains $100.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The savings account <b>pays interest at a fixed daily rate,</b> such that the amount in the savings account <b>increases by 10% each year relative to its beginning-of-year value.</b> This means: the monetary amount increases each day, such that overall it increases by 10% over the course of each year.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will ask for your best estimate of <b>how much money is in the account at a certain future point in time. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also enter digits in your estimate, such as $106.78.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the time horizon will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    
   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will estimate how much money will be in the savings account.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your estimate. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your estimate is correct.    
    </li>
   </ul>
