    <br>
    In this study you are a farmer who needs <b>to split 100 barrels of water for irrigating your crops between two growing seasons:  Spring and Summer.</b>  Your job is to allocate the water between seasons <b> to maximize your total crop yield.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Your total crop yield is equal to all of your Spring crop yield plus 90% of your Summer crop yield (some of your crop goes bad in the Summer months).
    </li>
    <li>
        Your crop yield in each season depends on how much water you allocate to that season.   Specifically in each season your yield is determined by the following formula.
     
    <div class="plot-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; " >
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">

            <div>
                <b>
                    Crop yield in a given season = <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                        <span style="font-size: 24px;">&radic;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Barrels of Water&nbsp;</span>
                        </span>
                </b>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The more water you allocate to a season, the higher the crop yield in that season.</b> However, while the first barrels of water allocated to a season have a large yield, <b>the additional yield from allocating more and more water in the season gets smaller.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, while the crop yield from 45 barrels of water in a given season is higher than the crop yield from 40 barrels of water, the yield boost derived from those additional 5 barrels is much smaller than the yield boost that results from using 5 versus 0 barrels of water. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This makes it valuable to allocate water <b>to both seasons.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In the Spring, the amount of water that determines the crop yield is exactly the amount you allocate.  But <b>in the Summer there will be a weather shock that either increases or decreases the water</b> you allocate to the season:
        <ul>
            <li>
               <b> With 50% chance, a certain amount of water will be added,</b> increasing your yield in the Summer.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> With the remaining 50% chance, a certain amount of water will be removed,</b> decreasing your yield in the Summer (though you cannot have less than 0 barrels of water).
            </li>
            <li>
                In each round, you will be told <b>the size of the weather shock: the amount of water that gets either added to or removed from the reservoir in the Summer.</b>  You will then decide how you allocate your water between the Spring and Summer.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <li>
            The size of the weather shock is an important consideration for how you allocate your water:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>If the weather shock is large, you run the risk of having only very little water in the Summer,</b> which would have a large negative effect on your expected crop yield.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also allocate fractions of Barrels, such as 6.7 Barrels.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the size of the weather shock varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in that one round will determine your bonus.

    Your decisions  may affect your bonus. If a round in this study is selected for payment, the computer will randomly determine the outcome of the weather shock. We will then calculate your earnings as described above. Your bonus then equals

        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = Total yield/2

    What this means is that it is in your best interest <b>to allocate your points in a way that maximizes the total crop yield.</b>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the amount of water that gets randomly added to or removed from whatâ€™s left in your reservoir in the Summer is 23 barrels.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how to split your 100 barrels of water between the two seasons.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how to split the water between the two seasons.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
