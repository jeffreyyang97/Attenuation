    <u>Your task:</u>

    In this study, you will <b>play a game with 2 other participants</b>. This game works as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each of you will be given <b>100 points</b>. At the end of the study, each participant will be paid 10 cent for each point they have.  
        </li>
    <li>
        Each of you simultaneously and independently decides <b>how many points to transfer into a shared account.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Whichever number of points each player transfers into <b>the shared account gets multiplied by a number</b> that we will call the <b>Multiplier</b>. For example, if the Multiplier is 2 and you transfer 30 of your points into the shared account, then 60 points will end up in the shared account.
    </li>
    <li>
        This means: <b>the higher the Multiplier, the more points you and the other participants will get from the shared account for each point any of you transfer into the shared account.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        	After all participants have decided how many points to transfer, <b>all points in the shared account get distributed equally among the three participants. </b>
            For example, if there are 90 points in the shared account in total, then you each get 30 points from the shared account, regardless of how many points each of you transferred into the shared account.
    </li>
    <li>
        	You will also each keep any of the 100 points you didn’t put in the shared account.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your total point score is thus calculated as follows:
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Total points = 
                    <br>
<b>                    Points not transferred into shared account + One third of total number of points in shared account 
</b>            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round you will be told the Multiplier that determines how many points end up in the shared account for each point that you transfer.  You will then decide how many points to transfer to the shared account (you will not see how many points the other participants sent to the shared account until the end of the study).
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the Multiplier varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your (and the other participants’) bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment and the bonus payment of the other participants.  If a decision in this part is selected for payment you will be paid 10 cents for each point you have.

            In this example, the Multiplier is 1.5.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how many points to transfer to the shared account.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        	How many points you want to transfer into the shared account.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
