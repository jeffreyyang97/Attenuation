    In this part of the study, you <b>will choose how to split 100 points between two pots, Pot 1 and Pot 2, in order to maximize your earnings.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The points in each pot separately generate earnings according to the following figure and formula: 
    </li>
    <div class="plot-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; " >
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">

            <div>
                <b>
                    Earnings from pot = <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                        &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Points in pot&nbsp;</span>
                        </span>
                </b>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>The more points that end up in a given pot, the more money you get.</b> However, <b>each additional point in a pot earns you less and less additional money.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For example, while the earnings from 45 points in a given pot are higher than the earnings from 40 points, the earnings boost derived from those 5 additional points is much smaller than the earnings boost thats result from having 5 versus 0 points in that pot. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This means that in order to maximize your earnings you should make sure that you always have a certain number of points in both pots.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        How many points end up in each pot depends on the number of points you allocate to either pot, as well as the outcome of a lottery. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The lottery will <b>either add or remove a specific number of points X from Pot 2. </b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With 50% chance, X points will be <b>added</b> to your Pot 2, increasing your earnings from Pot 2. 
            </li>
            <li>
                With the remaining 50% chance, X points will be <b>removed</b> from your Pot 2, decreasing your earnings from Pot 2. If you allocated fewer than or equal to X points to Pot 2, there will be zero points left in Pot 2 in this case.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Your total earnings are equal to the following equation: 
        <center>
            <div class="formula_li">
                Earnings = <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                    &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Points allocated to Pot 1&nbsp;</span> + 0.9 &#x2715;
                    &radic;<span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Points allocated to Pot 2 +/- points added or removed by lottery&nbsp;</span>
                    </span>
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        Because the earnings generated by the points in Pot 2 are multiplied by 0.9, the points allocated to Pot 2 generate earnings at a slightly lower rate than points allocated to Pot 1.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to split your 100 points between Pot 1 and Pot 2.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will <b>be told the number, X, of points that the lottery either adds or removes from Pot 2.</b> You will then decide how you allocate your points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of points that the lottery can add or remove varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in that one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, the computer will play the lottery and determine whether points are added or removed from your allocation to Pot 2 in that round. We will then calculate earnings as described above. Your bonus then equals         
    <center>
        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = 6 + 1/200 &#x2715; Earnings 
        </div>
    </center>
    This means is that it is in your best interest to allocate your points in a way that maximizes your earnings.

            In this example, the number of points that get randomly added or removed to Pot 2 is 10.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how to split your 100 points between Pot 1 and Pot 2.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how to split your points between Pot 1 and Pot 2.  
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
