    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
        In this study, <b>you will play a game with another participant. You will choose an action ‘Top’ or ‘Bottom’. </b> You will be matched to <b>another participant in the study who will choose ‘Left’ or ‘Right’.</b>  The combinations of your two actions will determine each of your payments.    
    <ul>
    <li>
        Your earnings from your and the other player's choice will be shown in a payoff matrix like this one:
                <center>
            <img style="width: 450px;" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_VGzOTsBmTmhsB53" alt="">
        </center>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your choice determines the row of the matrix determining the payments (top row or bottom row);  the other player's choice determines the column of the matrix (left column or right column).  <b>Together they determine which one cell of the matrix determines both of your payments.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                In each cell of the table (each combination of your and the other player's choices), the <b>first number (shown in blue) gives the amount you would earn</b> and <b>the second number (shown in red) the amount the other player would earn.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                The amount '<u><b>X</b></u>', i.e. the payment that occurs if you choose Top and the other player Left,<b> will vary from round to round in the task.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you (and the other player) will be told X.   You will then each choose an action, which will determine your payment according to the payoff matrix.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the payment X varies.   These rounds are completely independent from one another.  If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

    Your decisions in this study may affect your bonus payment.  If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you and and the other player will earn the amounts in the matrix shown above that corresponds to your and the other player's choices.

            In the example above, X is equal to $5.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether to choose action Top or Bottom.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will choose action Top or Bottom.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.   
    </li>
   </ul>
