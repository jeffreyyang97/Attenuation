    <br>
        In this study, you will <b>act as a fictional consumer.</b> Your task is to maximize the consumer's happiness by deciding <b>how much of a fictional healthy drink to consume:</b> between 0 and 100 gallons for a given year.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consuming the drink generates both higher happiness through more health and lower happiness because of the costs of paying for the drink.
            </li>
        <li>
            <u>Health:</u> The consumer derives health from consuming the drink according to the following figure and  equation:
        </li>


    <div class="plot-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; " >

            <div>
                <b>
                    Health = 5 / 9 &#x2715;  Gallons consumed  &#x2715; (200 - Gallons consumed)
                </b>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <li>
        As you can see in the figure, your health increases in how much you consume. <b>It is always true that the more of the drink you consume the healthier you are.</b> However, <b>each additional gallon produces less and less additional health.</b> 
        For example, while the health derived from 100 gallons is higher than the health derived from 99 gallons, the additional health derived from the one additional gallon is much smaller than the additional health that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Costs:</u> You need to pay a price for each gallon you consume.
    </li>
    <center>
        <div class="formula_li">
            <b>
                Costs = Price per gallon (in Dollars) &#x2715; Gallons consumed
            </b>
        </div>
    </center>
    <li>
        <u>Total happiness:</u> The consumer’s total happiness is then given by:
    </li>
    <center>
        <div class="formula_li">
            <b>
                Total happiness = Health – Costs =</b>
            <br>
            <b>
               5 / 9 &#x2715; Gallons consumed &#x2715; (200 - Gallons consumed) - Price per gallon &#x2715; Gallons consumed
            </b>        
</div>
    </center>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the price of each gallon of the healthy drink.</b> You will then decide how much to consume.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also consume fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons of the healthy drink.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task.  Across these rounds, the price of the drink varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. 
    If a decision in this study is selected for payment, 
    you will receive $10 if your answer is within +/- 1 gallons of the consumption amount that 
    maximizes the consumer's happiness at the prevailing price of the heatlhy drink, and nothing otherwise.

    <!--



    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer the consumer’s total happiness is to the maximum possible total happiness, the higher your bonus will be:
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715;   (Consumer’s actual total happiness / Maximum attainable total happiness)&#178;
            </div>
        </center>
        where by "maximum attainable total happiness" we mean the consumer's overall happiness if he consumed that amount of the drink that actually maximizes his happiness at the prevailing price.
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by truthfully <b>telling us how many gallons of the drink you think maximize the total happiness of the fictional consumer.</b>

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much of the drink you consume.
        </li> 
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually the optimal decision, by which we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
