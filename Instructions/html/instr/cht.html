<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>guess whether a company’s earnings are high or low after getting advice from another participant. </b>
        <ul>
    <li>
     In total, there are 100 companies, 50 of which have high and 50 of which have low earnings. The computer <b>secretly and randomly selects one of these companies,</b> each with equal probability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is <b>to guess what the selected company’s earnings are.</b> Specifically, you have to indicate the percentage chance that you think that the company’s earnings are high.
    </li>
    <li>
        Before making your guess, you <b>may receive a message from another participant. </b>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This other participant <b>potentially</b> sees the company’s actual earnings. If they do observe those earnings, they can <b>choose to either Reveal or Not Reveal the actual earnings to you.</b> The other participant <b>cannot lie</b> about the earnings, <b>but they can choose to Not Reveal to you what they’ve seen. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            The bonus of this other participant depends on your guess about whether the company has high earnings: <b>the higher your guess, the more money the other participant receives</b> 
            <div class="tooltip_ext1">

                    The other participant’s chances of winning $20 increases in your guess about how likely it is that the company’s earnings are high.

        </li>
        <li>
            This means: the other participant <b>has an opportunity to get you to guess that the company’s earnings are high by selectively revealing the earnings</b> to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whether or not the other participant actually observes the company’s earnings is decided by a <b>random computer draw</b>. With some percentage chance, the other participant observes the earnings. With the remaining percentage chance, they observe nothing.
        </li>
        <li>
            This means: if you do not get a message from the other participant, it is either because <b>the other participant was not selected to observe the company’s earnings</b>, or because they were <b>selected to observe the earnings but decided to Not Reveal to you.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            When choosing to Reveal or Not Reveal, the other participant knows that you know their percentage chance of observing the earnings.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Whenever you do receive a message from the other participant, you will know the company’s actual earnings with certainty, and <b>hence it is straightforward to make your guess. We will not ask you for your guess in those rounds. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Instead, we will <b>only ask for your guess in rounds in which you don’t receive a message from the other participant.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the <b>other participant’s chance of observing the company’s earnings.</b> Your will then make your guess.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also guess fractions, such as 6.78%.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the other participant’s chance of observing the actual earnings will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, you may win a bonus of $10. Your chances of winning that bonus depend on whether a round with or without a message gets selected.
   <ul>
        <li>
            <b>If round with message selected:</b> This means the other participant was selected to observe the company’s earnings and decided to Reveal. In this scenario, you will win the $10 with certainty since you know the truth. Recall that we will simply skip these rounds when asking about your guesses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If round without message selected:</b> 
            This means that either the other participant was not selected to observe earnings, or they were selected to observe earnings but chose to Not Reveal. These are the 13 rounds in which we ask for your guesses. In this case, your chance of winning the $10 bonus is given by the accuracy of your guess. If you’re interested, you can
