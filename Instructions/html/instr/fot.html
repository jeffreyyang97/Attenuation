    In this  study, <b>your task is to forecast the end-of-year earnings of a fictional firm</b> for the year 2024, based on the firm’s earnings over the previous two years.
    <ul>
    <li>
        The 2024 earnings of the firm depend on both a trend and year-specific luck. Specifically, the change in the firm’s earnings from 2023 to 2024 is determined by two components:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A <b>firm trend</b> equal to the previous change in the firm’s earnings from 2022 to 2023.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <b>yearly luck</b> component that is <b>zero on average</b>. Specifically, the yearly luck component will be a random draw from the numbers 
                <center>
                    (-8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
                </center>
                where each number is <b>equally likely to be drawn,</b> such that the luck component equals zero on average.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The relative importance of these two components is given by P, a share between 0 and 100%. In particular, the earnings change is given by the formula
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                2024 earnings – 2023 earnings  = 
                    <br>
                    <b>P</b>% &#x2715; (Firm trend) +  (100 – <b>P</b>)% &#x2715; (Yearly luck).
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be given a different firm to forecast. You will be told the earnings of that firm over the last two years, as well as the relative importance of each component, P. Your task is to <b>forecast what the firm's 2024 earnings will be, <u>on average</u>.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the relative importance P will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
    </ul>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions may affect your bonus payment. For each round, there will be a correct forecast of the average earnings of the firm. 
    If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you will receive $10 if your answer is within +/- $1 of the correct forecast, and nothing otherwise.

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the relative importance of the firm trend is 80% and that of yearly luck 20%, and the firm’s earnings over the last two years (2022 and 2023) are $109 and $127, respectively. 
        </li>
        <li>
            You would give your forecast of the average 2024 earnings of this firm, based on the information provided.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will forecast the 2024 earnings of the firm. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your forecast is actually the correct forecast of the firm's average earnings.
