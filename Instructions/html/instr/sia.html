    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be asked to <b>estimate the weight of a bucket.</b> You will not get to see the bucket yourself. Rather,<b> you will have to rely on the estimates of others.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        There are two different types of people: <b>2 Communicators</b> and <b>100 Estimators. </b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>Communicators</b> are called <b style="color: red;">Ann</b> and <b style="color: blue;">Bob</b>. Neither of them gets to see the bucket, either. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Estimators</b>, on the other hand, have all <b>independently seen the bucket and are all equally good at estimating its weight.</b> Each estimator produces their own estimate of the weight of the bucket. <b>The actual weight of the bucket is the average of these 100 estimates.</b> 
            </li>
            <li>
                Each of the 100 Estimators transmits their individual estimate either to Ann or to Bob. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Ann and Bob <b>compute the average of the estimates they observe,</b> and then communicate the two averages to you. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, Ann and Bob report these two averages to you. You will also be told <b>how many Estimators reported their estimates to Ann and to Bob,</b> respectively. Based on what you find out from Ann and Bob, your task is to estimate the weight of the bucket.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Estimators reporting to Ann and Bob as well as their estimates vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the delay of the future payment is 3 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether your prefer this delayed payment or a given immediate payment.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see choice lists such as the one below, where each row is a separate choice.
        </li>
    </ul>
    [ example choice list ] 
    <ul>
        <li>
            In every list, the right-hand option (Option B) is a delayed payment that is identical in all rows. The left-hand option (Option A) is an immediate payment. The immediate payment increases as you go down the list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            To make a choice just click on the option you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row), <span style="background-color: yellow;">highlighting your choice yellow. </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing Option A to choosing Option B.</b> You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting Option A in all rows above and Option B in all rays below your selected row. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on where you switch from Option A to Option B in this list, we assess which immediate payment (Option A) you value as much as the future payment (Option B). 
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, in the choice list above, you would value the future payment as much as an immediate payment between ?? and ??, because this is where switching occurs.
        </li>
    </ul>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between a future payment and different immediate payments. We will use these decisions to assess how much the delayed payment is worth to you. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that your guess is correct.
       </li>
