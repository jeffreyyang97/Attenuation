    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will act as a <b>fictional firm that produces and sells a single product</b>: gallons of cola.
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will choose how much cola to produce, between 0 and 100 gallons. You can <b>sell cola at a sales price of $12 per gallon. 
            </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each gallon will cost you a certain amount to produce.          
        </li>
       
            <li>
                In each round, you will be told how much each gallon costs to produce. You will then decide <b>how many gallons to produce.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                You must decide how many gallons to produce <b>before</b> you know for certain the “demand” quantity: the amount of cola your customers actually want to buy. The computer <b>randomly selects the demand from a range of 0 to 100 gallons</b>, with each whole number in the range <b>equally likely</b>. Gallons that you produce but for which there is no demand go to waste. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>This means:  </u>
            

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you produce <b>fewer</b> gallons than the available demand, you sell <b>all gallons that you produced,</b> but you also <b>lose sales you would have made if you’d produced more.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you produce <b>more</b> gallons than the available demand, you only sell <b>those gallons that meet the available demand.</b> The remaining gallons that <b>can’t be sold go to waste,</b> and you still need to <b>pay the cost of producing them.</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
           
                <li>
                    The <b>firm’s profit</b> is equal to the number of gallons you sell times the sales price of $12, minus the cost of producing gallons:
                </li>
                <center>
                    <div class="formula_li">
                        <b>
                            Firm profit = Gallons sold &#x2715; $12 – Gallons produced &#x2715; Cost of producing each gallon
                        </b>
                    </div>
                </center>
                <li>
                    You can also produce fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons. These result in fractional revenue just like whole gallons do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, <b>the cost of producing cola varies.</b> These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, we will calculate your profit as described above. Your bonus then equals:
            <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 4 + 1/300 &#x2715; Firm profit (or loss)
            </div>
        </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that it is in your best interest to <b>truthfully indicate the amount of cola you want to produce.</b>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the cost of producing each gallon is $5.        
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how many gallons to produce.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many gallons you want to produce.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
