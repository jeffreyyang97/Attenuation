    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
        In this part of the study, you <b>will guess a secret number after getting advice from another participant. </b>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <b>secret number will be randomly determined</b> by the computer, where each whole number between 1 and 9 is equally likely. You will not see the secret number. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to guess what the secret number is. The better your guess, the lower your penalty:
    </li>
    <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
        <div class="formula_li" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
            <div>Penalty&nbsp;</div>
            <div>
                = Distance between your guess and the secret number
                <br>
                = | your guess – secret number | 
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
  
    <li>
        <b>Your penalty is zero if you correctly guess the secret number. The closer your guess is to the true number, the lower your penalty.</b> 
    </li>
    <li>
        Before making your guess, you <b>will receive a hint from another participant. </b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The hint is a number between 1 and 9. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The other participant sees the secret number before giving their hint. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The other participant’s penalty also depends on your guess. However, the way in which the other particpant’s penalty is determined may be different from how yours is determined: 
                <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <div class="formula_li" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">
                        <div>Other participant’s penalty&nbsp;</div>
                        <div>
                            = Distance between “your guess plus X” and the secret number
                            <br>
                            = | your guess + X – secret number |
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                This means that <b>their penaly is zero if you guess a number that is X higher than the secret number.</b> The closer your guess is to the true number plus X, the lower the other participant’s penalty.
            </li>
            <li>
                We call X the <b>“preference difference”</b> between you and the other participant in this game.
            </li>
            <li>
                When choosing their hint, the other participant knows that you know about the preference difference.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to guess the secret number after receiving the hint from the other participant.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the preference difference between you and the other participant and see their hint. You will then try to guess the secret number.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the preference difference between you and the other participant will differ. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, your penalty will determine your bonus.     <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10 - 1/7  &#x2715; Penalty &#x2715; Penalty
            </div>
        </center>
        While this formula might look complicated, all this means is that you should thruthfully <b>provide your best guess of the secret number to maximize your bonus.</b>
