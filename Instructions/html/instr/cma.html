    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will act as a consumer who only likes milk and juice. The consumer’s overall happiness is given by the following expression, where quantities denote gallons:
<center>
    <div class="formula">
        Happiness = sqrt (milk) + sqrt (juice)
    </div>
</center>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <i> 
            As you can see in the figures, the consumer’s happiness increases in how much milk and juice he drinks. However, each additional gallon of milk or juice is worth less and less to the consumer. For example, while the happiness derived from 10 gallons of milk is higher than the happiness derived from 9 gallons, the happiness boost derived from the additional gallon is much smaller than the happiness boost that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons. 
           </i>
        </li>
        <li>
            The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on milk and juice. Juice always costs $1 a gallon, but the price of milk varies.
         </li>
       
            <li>
                In each round, you will be told the price of milk. You will then decide what share of your budget to spend on milk and what share on juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also buy fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons of milk.
            </li>
        <li>
            In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of milk varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
        </li>
