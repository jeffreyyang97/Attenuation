    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your task is to translate three-letter “words” into numerical code. 
    <ul>
    <li>
        	We will show you a translation table like this that tells you the numerical code for each letter:
   
          <center>
            <img style="width: 400px" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_KIjCYBEwZtUgMHb" alt="">
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        We will then show you a number of words like ZJC and boxes to type the numerical code for each of the three letters like this:
           
        <center>
            <img style="width: 200px" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_Em8jLusfQtEsVhw" alt="">
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        Simply enter the three digit code for each letter in the boxes next to the word. For instance in this example (given the table), you would type 422 in the first box, 683 for the second and 515 for the third.
    </li>
    <li>
        	You will complete as many word translations as you can within 2 minutes. We will measure your performance based on the number of words you correctly translate.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Competition:</b> You will compete against one other real, anonymous person this study. Your performance at the translation task will influence whether you win against your opponent. In general, the more words you correctly translate the more likely you are to win the competition and earn bonus money of up to $5.00.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>How Is the Winner Determined?</b> Your final score will be the total number of translations that you accurately complete. We will determine the winner in one of the following two ways:
    <ul>
        <li>
            By <b>Performance</b>:  We will compare your final score to your competitor’s final score; whoever has the highest score will win. If scores are tied, we will randomly match you with another opponent.
        </li> 
        <li>
            By <b>Chance</b>:  We will determine the winner by a virtual coin flip. We will not compare your final score to your competitor’s final score; you will have a 50-50 chance of winning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        You will know the percentage chance the winner is determined by Performance (rather than Chance) on the decision screen.     </li>
    <li>
        <b>Bottom line:</b>
        To maximize your chances of winning, complete as many word translations as you can in 2 minutes.    </li>
</ul>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u> 
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    We will randomly pair you with another participant who completed the same task. The payment you and the other participant will receive is based on a two-stage process.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stage 1: The winner earns $5.00 while the other participant earns $0.00. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Stage 2: A randomly selected third person <b>will be given the chance to redistribute earnings between you and your opponent.</b> 
            The third person will be <b>informed of the basic rules of the game, but won’t know your identity nor the identity of your opponent.</b> 
            This person will decide whether to redistribute earnings from the player who earned $5.00 to the player who earned $0. Based on the outcome of this stage, we will compute the final earnings of each player.
        </li> 
    </ul>

        In the example above, the percentage chance the winner is determined by Performance (rather than Chance) is 47%.
        </li>
        <li>
            	You then need to complete as many word translations as possible.
