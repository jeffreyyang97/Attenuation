    <br>
        In this study, you will <b>will estimate the number of black dots shown to you on a screen.</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                In each of multiple rounds, you will <b>see a box containing black dots for a second.</b>
            </li>
        <li>
        	Each box contains somewhere <b>between 50 and 150 dots.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            	After the box disappears, you have <b>10 seconds to type in your estimate of how many dots the box contained.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of dots in the box varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you receive $10 if your estimate is within +/-1 of the correct answer. If you take longer than ten seconds to type in your answer, you will not get a bonus.
    <!--



    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer the consumer’s total happiness is to the maximum possible total happiness, the higher your bonus will be:
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715;   (Consumer’s actual total happiness / Maximum attainable total happiness)&#178;
            </div>
        </center>
        where by "maximum attainable total happiness" we mean the consumer's overall happiness if he consumed that amount of the drink that actually maximizes his happiness at the prevailing price.
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by truthfully <b>telling us how many gallons of the drink you think maximize the total happiness of the fictional consumer.</b>

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many dots you think are in the box.
        </li> 
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your estimate is actually correct.
