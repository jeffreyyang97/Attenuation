    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you will decide whether to acquire a hint for guessing the site of a coin.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The computer will <b>flip a digital coin</b> which may land on Heads or Tails. 
        <center>
            <div class="par" style = "background-color: #F5F5F5; background: ghostwhite; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid lightgray;  display: inline-block; text-align: left; margin: 10px;">
                With <b>50%</b> chance: <b>Heads</b>
                <br>
                With <b>50%</b> chance: <b>Tails</b>
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        If this part of the study is selected for bonus payment, you will guess whether the coin landed Heads or Tails. If your guess is correct, you will be paid a <b>$10 bonus.  </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition,<b> you will be given a budget of $10. You will decide whether or not to purchase information that may help you make an informed guess about the coin flip.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The information comes in the form of a <b>hint</b>, such as “The coin came up Heads.” 
        </li>
        <li>
            The hint is not always correct but instead has an <b>accuracy rate</b>: the percent chance that the hint correctly states the outcome of the coin flip. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This accuracy rate is <b>always greater than or equal to 50%, meaning the hint is always more likely to be correct than incorrect.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            In each round, we will <b>tell you what the accuracy rate of the hint is.</b> You will then indicate how much you would at most be willing to pay, between $0 and $10, to actually receive the hint. As explained in greater detail below, the more you are willing to pay, the likelier it is that you actually receive the hint.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the accuracy rate of the hint varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment and whether you receive the hint. This works as follows:  
    <ul>
        <li>
            The computer will randomly select a payment amount between $0 and $10. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the amount selected by the computer is lower than your stated willingness to pay for the hint, you will receive the hint, and the amount selected by the computer will be subtracted from your budget. Then, your bonus payment will be your remaing budget plus $10 or $0, depending on whether you are able to correctly guess the side the coin landed on. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the amount selected by the computer is higher than your stated willingness to pay for the hint, you will not receive the hint. Then, your bonus payment will be your budget plus $10 or $0, depending on whether you are able to correctly guess the side the coin landed on.
        </li>
        <li>
            This procedure may seem complicated, but all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate how much at most you would pay for the hint, and to truthfully guess whether the coin came up Heads or Tails.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the hint has an accuracy rate of 70%, meaning that if the coin flip landed heads, there is a 70% chance the hint will correctly say heads, and that if the coin flip landed tails, there is a 70% chance the hint will correctly say tails.
        </li>
        <li>
            You would then indicate how much at most you would be willing to pay for the hint. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If this task is selected for payment, the computer will determine whether you receive the hint, following the procedure described above. You would then state your guess on whether the coin came up Heads or Tails. 
        </li>

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how much you are willing to pay for the hint. We will use this answer to determine how much you value the hint.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are that your decisions reflect how much you actually value the hint. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions reflect how much you value the hint, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
