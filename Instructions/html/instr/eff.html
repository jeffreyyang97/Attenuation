    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will <b>decide how much you want to work for a given wage.</b>

    You then decide how many tasks you would like to be assigned. Your payment for the work assignment equals the wage times the number of tasks you complete.
<ul>
    <li>
        You will be offered a wage for every task you complete. ou then decide how many tasks your work assignment should include. Your payment for the work assignment equals the <b>wage times the number of tasks you complete.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In every task you will be asked to count the number of 1s in a table wtih 144 cells such as the one below:
    </li>
    <center>
        <div class="formula_li">
           <img style="width: 540px;" src="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_ERqr94AuM59gloR" alt="">
        </div>
    </center>
    <li>
        To complete a task successfully, you have to <b>correctly count the number of 1s.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        A task that is not completed successfully will not count towards the total of tasks you need to complete for the assignment. Instead, <b>if you do not successfully complete a task, the computer will generate a new one.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the wage per task. You will then decide how many tasks your work assignment should include.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the wage varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment as well as how many tasks you will have to work on to receive your bonus. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you will have to complete the number of tasks you selected and you will receive the total payment for the assignment. If you do not complete the total number of tasks your assignment includes, you will not receive any bonus payment. There is no partial payment for partially completed assignments.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how many tasks you would like to complete given the wage you are offered. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
