    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will decide whether to earn a bonus of $1 or to instead have us give some amount of money to a charity.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The charity is the <b>Make-a-Wish foundation</b>, which helps to fulfill the wishes of children with critical illnesses.   Click <a href="https://wish.org/" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about the foundation.
        </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>how much money would be given to the charity if you decided to donate.</b>   You will then decide whether to donate this amount or instead earn a bonus of $1 for yourself.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you decide to donate to the charity, we <b>will really pay that amount to the charity.</b>  You will not have to pay anything, but you will forego earning the $1 bonus.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the amount donated to the charity varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

    <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<br>
Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment and how much goes to the charity. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you will earn your bonus (if you chose that option), or we will donate the amount from that round to the charity (if you chose that option).

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the charity would receive $1.70 if you chose to have us donate.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to click on the button to decide whether to pay yourself a bonus of $1 or instead to donate $1.70 to the charity.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        Whether you want to keep $1 for yourself or have us donate to the charity.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences.
    </li>
