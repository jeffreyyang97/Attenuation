    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will <b>decide between a lottery ticket and a safe payment.</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        A lottery ticket pays <b>$18 with some percentage chance, and $0 otherwise.</b> 
    </li>
    <li> 
        A safe payment is paid with certainty.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the <b>percentage chance of getting $18 from the lottery ticket.</b> You will then decide between the lottery ticket and different safe payment amounts.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the percentage chance the lottery ticket pays $18 varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</ul>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, the computer will randomly select one of your choices.
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you picked the lottery ticket, you will receive the outcome of the lottery, implemented by the computer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If you picked the safe payment, you will receive that payment.
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    This means that it is in your best interest to  <b>choose the option (lottery ticket or safe payment) you actually prefer in each case. </b>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the percentage chance of winning $18 is 1%.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether your prefer this lottery ticket or a given safe payment.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see choice lists, where each row is a separate choice.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In every list, the right-hand option (Option B) is a lottery ticket that is identical in all rows. The left-hand option (Option A) is a safe payment. The safe payment increases as you go down the list. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make a choice just click on the option you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row), <span style="background-color: lightyellow;">highlighting your choice yellow. </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing Option A to choosing Option B.</b>
                    You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting Option A in all rows above and Option B in all rows below your selected row.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on where you switch from Option A to Option B in this list, we assess which safe payment (Option A) you value as much as the lottery (Option B). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example, in the choice list above, you would value the lottery as much as a safe payment between $13 and $14 because this is where switching occurs.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between a lottery ticket and different safe payments. We will use these decisions to assess how much you value the lottery ticket. 
        </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect how much you value the lottery ticket, given your personal preferences and the available information.
    </li>
   </ul>
