    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will distribute points between other participants and yourself, which will determine everyone's payments.</b>
    <ul>
    <li> 
        You are the Receiver and will be given <b> 0 points</b> and be matched into a group with some number of other participants called <b>Payers</b>, who each start off <b>with 40 points.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Every point in the experiment is <b>worth $0.05</b> in bonus earnings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide how many points to award to yourself. Every point you award to yourself will result in <b>0.4 points</b> being subtracted from each of the Payers. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b> how many Payers there are.</b> You will then decide <b>how many points to award to yourself (and subtract from each of the Payers).</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, if there are 5 Payers and you award 20 points to yourself, then each of the 5 Payers ends up with 32 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also award fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Payers varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

    <u>Your bonus payment:</u>

Your decisions may affect the bonus payments of yourself and other participants in your group. 
Everyone in your group is making the <b>same decisions as you are.</b> 
If a decision in this study is selected for payment, the computer <b>will randomly decide who in the group is  assigned to be Payers who are given 40 initial points, and who is the Receiver who is given 0 initial points and decides</b> 
the allocation of points.  Since your decision only matters if you are selected to be the Receiver, it is best to make this decision as if you know for sure that you are the Receiver.

            In this example, there are 17 Payers.

        <li>
            You then need to type into the box the number (between 0 and 100) of points you would like to award to yourself (40% of which will be subtracted <b>from each</b> of the Payers).        </li>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:

   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points you would like to award to yourself and subtract from each of the Payers.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
