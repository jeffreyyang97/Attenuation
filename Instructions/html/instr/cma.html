    In this part of the study, you will act as a consumer who only likes milk and juice. <b> Your task is to maximize the consumer’s happiness.</b> The consumer’s overall happiness is given by the following expression, where quantities denote gallons:
<center>
    <div class="formula">
        <b>
            Happiness = &#8730;(milk) + &#8730;(juice)
        </b>
    </div>
</center>

        <div>
            <b>
                Happiness from milk = &#8730;(milk)

        <div>
            <b>
                Happiness from juice = &#8730;(juice)

    <ul>
        <li>            
            As you can see in the figures, the consumer’s happiness increases in how much milk and juice he drinks. However, <b>each additional gallon of milk or juice is worth less and less</b> to the consumer. For example, while the happiness derived from 100 gallons of milk is higher than the happiness derived from 99 gallons, the happiness boost derived from the additional gallon is much smaller than the happiness boost that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons.
        </li>
        <li>
            The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on milk and juice. Juice always costs $1 a gallon, <b>but the price of milk varies.</b>
         </li>
       
            <li>
                In each round, you <b>will be told the price of milk</b>. You will then decide <b>how many gallons of milk and how many gallons of juice to buy</b>, where the maximal amount for each drink is 11,000 gallons.
            </li>
            <li>
                In each round, you <b>need to spend your entire budget of $100</b>. To keep things simple, we will ask you how many gallons of milk you want to buy, and then the computer will automatically and instantly display for you how many gallons of juice you would get with the money that’s left over.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also buy fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons of milk.
            </li>
        <li>
            In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of milk varies. <b>These rounds are completely independent from one another.</b> If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, we will calculate the consumer’s happiness as described above. Your bonus then equals     
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715; (Consumer’s Happiness / Maximal Happiness)
            </div>
        </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate the amount of milk and juice that you think maximizes the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

        <li>
            In this example, the cost of milk is $3.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how much milk to buy. Based on your decision, the computer will instantly determine how much juice you would get, given the prices and your total budget.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much milk you buy.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
       </li>
   </ul>
