    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, we ask you to imagine that <b>you are a farmer who needs to split water for irrigation between the two growing seasons</b> this year. You have a <b>fixed amount of water in a reservoir</b>. <b>Your objective is to maximize your happiness, which depends on your crop yield in the two growing seasons.</b> The challenge lies in the unpredictability of the weather in the second growing season.
    <ul>
    <li>
        Your water reservoir <b>contains a total of 100 barrels of water</b> that you can only use in the two growing seasons of the current year. There is no point in saving water for later years because rain will fill up the reservoir after the second season anyways.
    </li>
 
    <li>
        Specifically, in each season the crop yield is determined by the following formula
    
    <div class="plot-container" style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; " >
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">

            <div>
                <b>
                    Crop yield in a given season = <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                        <span style="font-size: 24px;">&radic;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Barrels of Water&nbsp;</span>
                        </span>
                </b>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The more water you allocate to a season, the higher the crop yield in that season.</b> However, while the first barrels of water allocated to a season have a large yield, <b>the additional yield from allocating more and more water in the season get smaller.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, while the crop yield from 45 barrels of water in a given season is higher than the crop yield from 40 barrels of water, the yield boost derived from those additional 5 barrels is much smaller than the yield boost that results from using 5 versus 0 barrels of water. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        This means: it is important <b>that you have some water available in both periods.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In the first season, the weather is perfectly predictable. Your challenge is <b>the weather in the second season: There’s a 50% chance of experiencing a drought,</b> in which case <b>some of the water in your reservoir dries up</b> and cannot be used for irrigation. Conversely, there's also a <b>50% chance of rain, adding some water to your reservoir</b> in the second season.
    </li>
    <li>
        This means: how much total crop yield you end up with <b>depends on the amount of water you allocate to each season, as well as the random outcome of a weather “lottery” in the second season. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The weather lottery will either add or remove a specific amount of water to whatever water is left in the reservoir for the second season. 
        <ul>
            <li>
               <b> With 50% chance, a certain amount of water will be added,</b> increasing your yield in the second season. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> With the remaining 50% chance, a certain amount of water will be removed,</b> decreasing your yield in the second season (you cannot have less than 0 barrels of water in the reservoir).
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>amount of water that gets added or removed</b> (the size of the weather shock) <b>varies</b> across the rounds in this study. In some rounds, the weather is very volatile such that large amounts of water can get added or removed, while in other rounds the weather is more stable, so that relatively little water can get added or removed.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you make your decision, <b>you will not know whether the weather shock adds or removes water</b>. All you will know is the precise amount of water that gets added or removed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
            Your goal is <b>to maximize your total happiness</b> from the crop yield in <b>both</b> seasons. Your total happiness is given by the following equation: 
        <center>
            <div class="formula_li" style="font-weight: bold;">
                Happiness  = First season yield + <u>90%</u> of second season yield
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        This reflects that the crop yield in the second season is worth a bit less to you because it only accrues in the future.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the amount of water that the weather lottery either adds or removes from the reservoir</b> in the second growing season. You will then decide how you allocate your water.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the size of  the weather shock varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in that one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</ul>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus. If a round in this part is selected for payment, the computer will play the lottery and determine whether water is added or removed from your allocation to the second season. We will then calculate your earnings as described above. Your bonus then equals 
    <center>
        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = Happiness/2
        </div>
    </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that it is in your best interest to <b>allocate your points in a way that maximizes the farmer’s happiness.</b>

        <li>
            In this example, the amount of water that gets randomly added to or removed from what’s left in your reservoir in the second season is 10 barrels.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how to split your 100 barrels of water between the two periods.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how to split the water between the two periods.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
