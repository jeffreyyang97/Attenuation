    In this part of the study, you will act as a consumer who only consumes milk and juice. Your task is <b>to maximize the consumer’s happiness by deciding how much juice and milk to buy</b>.

<ul>
    <li>
        The consumer’s overall happiness is given by the square root of the amount of milk consumed plus the square root of the amount of juice consumed, where amounts are measured in gallons:

Here’s how the amount of milk and juice consumed translate into happiness:

        <div>
            <b>
                Happiness from juice =   <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                    <span style="font-size: 30px;">&radic;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;juice&nbsp;</span>

  <li>
    As you can see in the figures, the <b>consumer’s happiness increases in how much milk and juice he drinks.</b> However, <b>each additional gallon of milk or juice produces less and less additional happiness.</b> For example, while the happiness derived from 100 gallons of milk is higher than the happiness derived from 99 gallons, the happiness increase resulting from the additional gallon is much smaller than the happiness increase that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons. 
  </li>
  <li>
            The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on milk and juice. Juice always costs $1 a gallon, <b>but the price of milk varies.</b>
         </li>
       
            <li>
                Because the budget is $100 and the price of juice is $1, you can always <b>buy at most 100 gallons of juice.</b> Because the price of milk varies, the maximal amount of milk you can buy also varies, though there’s a limit of 11,000 gallons based on how much the supermarket has in stock.
            </li>
            <li>
                In each round, you need to spend your entire budget of $100. To keep things simple, we will ask you how many gallons of juice you want to buy, and then the computer will automatically and instantly display for you how many gallons of milk you would get with the money that’s left over.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also buy fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons of juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of milk varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, we will calculate the consumer’s happiness as described above. Your bonus then equals         
    <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715; (Consumer’s Happiness / Maximal Happiness)
            </div>
        </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate the amount of milk and juice that you think maximizes the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

            In this example, the price of milk is $3 per gallon.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how much juice to buy. Based on your decision, the computer will instantly calculate your total expenditure for juice, and will determine how much milk you would get, given the prices and your total budget.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much milk you buy.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
