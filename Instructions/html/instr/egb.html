    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will <b>estimate the value of a savings account that currently contains $120. </b>
<ul>
    <li>
        The savings account pays interest <b>at a fixed daily rate,</b> such that the amount in the savings account increases <b>by 10% each year relative to its beginning-of-year value.</b> This means: the monetary amount increases each day, such that overall over the course of a year it increases by 10%.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will ask for your best estimate of <b>how much money is in the account at a certain future point</b> in time. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, <b>the time horizon will vary.</b> These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer your answer to the correct answer, the higher your bonus will be:        
    <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10 - 0.05  &#x2715; (Your answer – Correct answer) &#x2715; (Your answer – Correct answer)
            </div>
        </center>
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by truthfully <b>telling us how much money you think the savings account will contain.</b>

            In this example, we are asking you to estimate the content of the savings account two years from now.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
    How much money will be in the savings account.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
       </li>
   </ul>
