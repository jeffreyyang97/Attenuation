<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, there are two hypothetical racing horses called "A" and "B". Each of these horses wins prize money, where the more you practice with each horse, the more money it wins. In total, <b>you have 135 hours of practice that you need to allocate between the two horses to maximize the total prize money.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>You receive a certain percentage of each horse’s prize money</b>, where the percentages across the two horses <b>always sum up to 90%</b>. For example, you may receive 50% of Horse A’s prize money and 40% of Horse B’s, or you may receive 75% of Horse A’s and 15% of Horse B’s prize money, and so on. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The figures below show you how much prize money each horse wins depending on how many hours you practice with it. Both horses win more money the more you practice with them.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <li>
                In each round, you will be told <b>what percentages of each horse’s prize money you receive</b>. You will then decide how you allocate training time between the two horses.             </li>
            <li>
                You can also allocate fractions of hours, such as 6.78 hours. These result in fractional prize money just like whole hours do.
            </li>
        <li>
            In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the percentages of the prize money you get for either horse vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.        </li>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer your earned prize money is to the maximum possible prize money, the higher your bonus will be:        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10 &#x2715; (Your prize money / Maximum attainable prize money)&#178;
            </div>
        </center>
        where by "maximum attainable prize money" we mean the total prize money you would receive if you allocated the training time optimally.
        While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by truthfully telling us <b>which allocation of practice hours you think maximizes the total prize money you receive</b> from the horses.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many hours to practice with each horse.    
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually the optimal decision, by which we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
