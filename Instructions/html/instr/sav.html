    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be asked <b>to make a savings decision.</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        You will receive a <b>budget of 100 points,</b> each of which is worth $0.10. At the end of the study, we will convert your points earned into Dollars.   
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to decide how much of your budget to <b>receive immediately</b> and <b>how much to save until six months</b> from now. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The amount that you <b>save will earn interest</b> at an interest rate that will be shown to you. You will not earn interest on money you choose to receive immediately. For example, if the interest rate is 5% and you save 50 points, you will receive 50*1.05=52.5 points in six months.
    </li>
    <li>
        If this task is selected for the bonus payment, <b>there is no risk that you won’t receive the money</b> you save. We <b>guarantee that the amount that you save, plus the interest it accrues, will be delivered to your account in six months</b>. When a payment is delivered, we will also send you a reminder through Prolific to cash out the payment.  
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also save fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, <b>the interest rate varies.</b> These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your saving decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you will <b>receive the money you don’t save today, and you will receive the money you save and the interest it accrues six months from now.</b>

            You then need to decide how many of your 100 points to save.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
    <li>
        How much you save.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
