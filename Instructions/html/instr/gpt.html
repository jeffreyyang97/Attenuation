    <br>
        In this part of the study, <b>you will make a series of hypothetical decisions about how much you would be willing to pay for a specific quantity of a given product.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Imagine that you are <b>given a budget of $20</b>. You will then see <b>a description of the product and the quantity you would receive. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to indicate the <b>precise dollar amount (between $0 and $20) that you would at most be willing to pay.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Imagine that these items would be shipped to your home address without any additional shipping costs.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>what the product is and which quantity is for sale.</b> You will then decide how much <b> you would at most be willing to pay.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also indicate your willingness to pay in cents, such as $6.78.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the fraction of the funding that is lost varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

        	How much would you at most be willing to pay. We will use this answer to determine how much you value the product.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will ask you how certain you are that your decisions reflect how much you actually value the product. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions reflect how much you value the product, given your personal preferences and the available information.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much you would support the spending bill.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the best decision you can take, given your personal preferences and the available information.
