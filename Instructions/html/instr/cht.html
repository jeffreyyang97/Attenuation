<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>guess a secretly drawn number based on advice from another participant.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The computer randomly <b>raws a “secret number” between 0 and 20 with equal probability.</b> This means that each of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on all the way up to 20 are equally likely to come up. You will not see which secret number was drawn. If you guess it well enough, you will receive a bonus of $5.
            </li>
    <li>
        Before making your guess, you will receive a message from another participant. This other participant sees the secret number and then chooses which number to report to you. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The other participant <b>can report the actual secret number to you or a different one.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The other participant’s decision about which number to report to you may be influenced by how they get paid: <b>for each unit increment that your guess lies above the secret number, they get an amount <span style="color: blue;">$x</span>.</b> We call this number x the other’s “overestimation premium”.
        <ul>
           <li>
            For example: if the secret number number is 10, your guess is 15 and the other’s overestimation premium is $1.00, the other participant gets 5 &#x2715; $1.00 = $5.00.
           </li>
           <li>
            This means: <b>The higher the overestimation premium, the more the other participant benefits from you guessing a higher number.</b>
           </li>
           <li>
            When choosing which number to report, the other participant knows that you know what their overestimation premium is.
           </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>the other participant’s overestimation premium before you make your guess.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the other participant’s overestimation premium will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you will receive $5 if your guess is within +/-1 of the secret number, and nothing otherwise.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the other participant’s overestimation premium for your guess was $0.30, and they decided to report to you that the secret number was 8.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then then make your guess by picking a number between 0 and 20.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        	You will state what you think is the secret number.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible decision, given the available information? 
    </li>
   </ul>
