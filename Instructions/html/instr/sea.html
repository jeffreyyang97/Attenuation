    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, the computer <b>will repeatedly draw poker chips from a digital bag</b> to determine your bonus. You need to decide for how long you want the computer to keep drawing.     
    <ul>
            <li>
                The bag contains 100 poker chips, each worth a different number of points.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The least valuable chip in the bag is worth 1 point and the most valuable is worth 100 points and there is a chip in the bag worth each point value in-between. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every point is worth $0.10 to you for your bonus.
                    </li>
                </ul>   
            </li>
    <li>
        The computer will <b>repeatedly draw a poker chip from the bag (replacing the chip in the bag after each draw) until it gets one that is higher than some minimum value.</b>  Your job is to tell the computer <b>what you would like this minimum value to be:</b>   <b>the first chip that the computer draws that is at least as large as the minimum value will determine your base bonus.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        However, <b>each time</b> the computer draws a chip from the bag, it will <b>charge you some cost that will be subtracted</b> from your base bonus to determine your overall bonus. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to set the minimum value. Setting this minimum value has two effects: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, <b>the higher the minimum value you set, the more valuable the chip that will determine your base bonus.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                Second, <b>the higher your minimum, the larger the number of times (on average)</b> the computer will have to draw from the bag before getting a chip that is large enough,<b> meaning a higher cost.</b>
            </li>
        </ul> 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, <b>you will be told the cost </b>the computer will charge each time it draws a chip from the bag.  You will then decide on the minimum chip value (between 1 and 100) you would like the computer to use to decide when to stop drawing chips from the bag.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost charged per draw from the bag varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions In this study may affect your bonus payment.  If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you will <b>earn a number of points equal to the final poker chip drawn by the computer, minus the total cost from the number of draws taken by the computer.</b>  You will earn $0.10 for each resulting point (there is no chance of losing money based on your choice).  
    <b>Instead of calculating this once, we will have the computer make the full set of draws 1 million times, and pay you your average earnings over all of these repetitions of the problem.  This means there is no risk in this study and also that the decision that maximizes the average earnings also maximizes your bonus.</b>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the computer will charge you 10 points every time it draws a poker chip from the bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide on the minimum poker chip value, between 1 and 100, that the computer should use to decide when to stop drawing chips from the bag.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul> 
       <li>
        You will decide on the minimum value of a poker chip the computer can use to decide when to stop drawing chips from the bag.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually the optimal decision, by which we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.    </li>
   </ul>
