    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will act as a consumer who only consumes pasta and juice. Your task is  <b>to maximize the consumer’s overall happiness by deciding how much pasta and juice to consume.</b>

<ul>
    <li> 
        The consumer’s overall happiness is given by:
    <center>
    <div class="formula">
        <b>Overall happiness = 
            <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                pounds of pasta
            </span> &#x2715; 
                 <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                    gallons of juice
                </span>
        </b>

    </div>
</center>
  </li>
  <li>
    As you can see from the formula, the <b>consumer’s happiness increases in how much pasta and juice s/he consumes. </b>
</li>
<li>
    However, there is a strong interaction effect: 
            <ul>
            <li>
               <b> Consuming more pasta gives more happiness the more juice the consumer drinks. </b>
            </li>
            <li>
                Likewise, <b>consuming more juice gives more happiness the more pasta the consumer eats.</b>
            </li>  
        </ul>
       
</li>
<li>
    Put simply, consuming pasta alone, or consuming juice alone, does not generate much happiness. Instead, consuming both together gives greater happiness.
</li>
  <li>
    However, the consumer also has to take into account the prices of pasta and juice because they do not always cost the same. For example, even if the consumer would in principle like to consume pasta and juice in equal quantities, <b>this may be inefficient when one of them is cheaper than the other.</b>
</li>
<li>
    The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on pasta and juice. You need to spend your entire budget in each round.
</li>
<li>
   <b> Juice always costs $2 a gallon, but the price of pasta varies.</b>
</li>
<li>
    To keep things simple, we will ask you how many pounds of pasta you want to consume, and then the computer will automatically and instantly display for you how many gallons of juice you would get with the remaining money. The computer will also instantly display for you how much you spend on pasta and juice in total.
</li>
<li>
    In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of pasta varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
</li>
    </ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
       

    Your decisions may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you will receive $10 if your answer is within +/- 1 pounds of the amount of pasta that maximizes the consumer's overall happiness at the prevailing prices, and nothing otherwise.


    

    <!--

        Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. 
    If a decision in this study is selected for payment, 
    we will calculate the consumer’s overall happiness as described above
    <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715; (Consumer’s overall happiness / Maximal overall happiness)&#178;
            </div>
        </center>
    where by "maximal overall happiness" we mean the consumer's overall happiness if he bought those amounts of milk and juice that actually maximize his overall happiness at the prevailing prices.
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate the amounts of milk and juice that you think maximize the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

            In this example, the price of pasta is $2.1 per pound.
        </li>
        <li>
            	You then need to decide how many pounds of pasta to consume. Based on your decision, the computer will instantly calculate how much juice you would get, given the prices and your total budget.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many pounds of pasta you consume.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually the optimal decision, by which we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
