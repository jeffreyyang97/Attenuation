    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will distribute points between other participants, which will determine their payments.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        You will be given <b>100 points</b> and be matched into a group with
        <ul>
            <li>
                another participant called the <b>Receiver</b>, who starts with <b>0 points</b>, and 
            </li>
            <li>
                some number of other participants called <b>Payers</b>, who each start off <b> with 100 points</b>.   
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Every point in the experiment is <b>worth $0.05</b> in bonus earnings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide how many points to award to the Receiver.  Every point you award to the Receiver will result in <b>0.2 points</b> being subtracted from each of the Payers. However, your points will not be affected at all by your decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>how many Payers there are.</b>  You will then decide <b>how many points to award to the Receiver (and subtract from each of the Payers).</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, if there are 5 Payers and you award 20 points to the Receiver, then the Receiver ends up with 20 points and each of the 5 Payers ends up with 96 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also award fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Payers varies.  These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions may affect the bonus payments of the other participants in your group.  Everyone in your group is making <b>the same decisions</b> as you are.  If a decision in this study is selected for payment, the computer will <b>randomly decide who in the group is assigned to be the Receiver, who are assigned to be Payers, and whose decision is assigned to “count”</b> to determine the earnings of the other participants assigned to be Receivers and Payers.  If your decision is the one that counts, you will <b>earn 100 points for sure</b> and your decisions will <b>only affect the Receivers and Payers in your group.</b>    Since your decision only matters if you are selected to decide, it is best to make this decision as if you know for sure that you are the person whose decision counts.

            In this example, there are 17 Payers.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points you would like to award to the Receiver and subtract from each of the Payers.    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
