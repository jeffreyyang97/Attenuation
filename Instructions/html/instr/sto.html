    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be asked 
<b>to forecast the total growth of the U.S. stock market over different time horizons.</b><ul>
    <li>
        By “U.S. stock market” we mean the S&P500 index that calculates the average stock market performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell <b>you what the time horizon is.</b> You will then be asked to forecast total stock market growth (in percent) over this horizon. 
    </li>

    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the time horizon varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>

            In this example, the time horizon is 1 year.

        <li>
            You then need to forecast total stock market growth over the next year.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
    <li>
        Your forecast of stock market growth.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that yours is the best forecast one can make, given today’s information.
       </li>
   </ul>
