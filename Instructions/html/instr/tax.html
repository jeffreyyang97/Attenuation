    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you will estimate the income taxes owed by a hypothetical taxpayer named Fred. </b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Fred is a 32-year-old U.S. citizen. Fred is filing his 2024 U.S. Federal Tax Return, claiming a Single filing status with <b>no dependents.</b> Fred will <b>claim the standard deduction.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fred’s tax computation is particularly simple, since <b>all of his taxable income comes from his annual salary.</b> He has <b> no other sources of taxable income,</b> and is <b>not claiming additional credits, deductions, or exemptions.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        For all hypothetical payments in this part of the study, <b>please treat them as if you know you will receive them with certainty,</b> even if they are delayed. That is, please assume there is no risk that you wouldn’t actually get paid.  
    </li>
    <li>
            In each round, we will ask you to estimate the <b>total federal income tax</b> Fred would have to pay for <b>different levels of his annual salary.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the annual salary of Fred varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you earn $10 if you are within $200 of the correct answer. 
    While this may look complicated, all it means is that <b>you maximize your bonus by truthfully telling us how much you think Fred would have to pay in income taxes.</b>

        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to estimate how much Fred would have to pay in federal income taxes.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will estimate how much Fred would have to pay in federal income taxes. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are that your answer is actually correct. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your answer is correct.
       </li>
   </ul>
