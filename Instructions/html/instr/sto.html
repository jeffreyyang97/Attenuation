    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will be asked 
<b>to forecast the value of a $100 investment into different financial assets for different time horizons.</b><ul>
    <li>
        Each financial asset will be an investment fund that replicates the performance of other assets, like stock indices, bonds, or commodities, and can be bought and sold on stock exchanges like individual stocks.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell you <b>what the investment fund is</b> and <b>what the time horizon is</b>. You will then be asked to <b>forecast the value of a $100 investment</b> into this asset over this horizon. 
    </li>

    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the financial asset and the time horizon varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the asset is an investment fund replicating the S&P500 and the forecasting horizon is 10 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to forecast the value of a $100 investment into this fund over the next 10 months.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
    <li>
        Your forecast of the future value of a $100 investment.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible forecast, given the information you have today.
    </li>
