    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>make hypothetical decisions about which of two cars you would prefer to lease.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Imagine you are moving to a new city where you will be spending the next 3 years on a work contract. For your daily commute within the city as well as your other transportation needs, <b>you have decided to lease a car for those 3 years. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You have narrowed down your options to <b>two</b> vehicles.

        The <b>Camry Hybrid</b> model (left) will be <b>more expensive to lease, but will result in fuel cost savings relative to the <b>Camry</b> (right) </b> because it has a higher miles-per-gallon (MPG) rating. Over the next three years, fuel will cost $3 a gallon, on average. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be given a different scenario. In each scenario, we will <b>tell you how many miles you expect to drive each year.</b> You will then make a series of leasing decisions between the two vehicles above, under different assumptions on the total annual leasing costs. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. 
        Across these rounds, the number of miles you expect to drive in the scenario will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

    <ul> 
        <li>
            In this example, you expect to drive 7,500 miles each year and the cost of fuel averages out to $3 per gallon.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will need to decide which car to lease based on the total annual leasing costs and other vehicle features.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will make your decisions in a choice list, <b>where each row is a separate choice.</b>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    In every list, the left-hand option is the Camry Hybrid at $4,900 a year, and is identical in all rows. The right-hand option is the Camry at some annual leasing cost. This leasing cost decreases from row-to-row as you go down the list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make a choice just click on the radio button you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing the Camry Hybrid to choosing the Camry.</b> 
                    You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting the Camry Hybrid in all rows above and the Camry in all rows below your selected row.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on where you switch from the Camry Hybrid to the Camry in this list, we will assess how much more you are willing to pay annually to lease the Camry Hybrid as opposed to the Camry. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example, in the choice list above, your choice suggests that you are willing to pay between $200 and $250 more annually.
                </li>
            </ul>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between the two leasing options. We will use these decisions to assess how much more you would be willing to pay to lease the Camry Hybrid relative to the Camry. 
    </li>
    <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect how much more you would be willing to pay to lease the Camry Hybrid relative to the Camry, given your personal preferences and the available information.
    </li>
   </ul>
