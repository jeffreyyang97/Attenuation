    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b> you will decide between two hypothetical car lease options.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Imagine you are moving to a new city where you will be spending the next 3 years on a work contract. For your daily commute within the city as well as your other transportation needs, <b>you have decided to lease a car for those 3 years. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You have narrowed down your options to <b>two</b> vehicles.

        The Camry Hybrid model will be <b>more expensive to lease, but will result in fuel cost savings relative to the Camry</b> because it has a higher miles-per-gallon (MPG) rating. Over the next three years, fuel will cost $3 a gallon, on average. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be given a different scenario. In each scenario, we will <b>tell you how many miles you expect to drive each year.</b> You will then make a series of leasing decisions between the two vehicles above, under different assumptions on the total annual leasing costs. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the scenario about how many miles you expect to drive will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In every list, the left-hand option (Option A) is the Camry Hybrid at $4900 a year, and is identical in all rows. The right-hand option (Option B) is a Camry at some annual leasing cost. This leasing cost decreases as you go down the list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see choice lists such as the one below, where each row is a separate choice.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>
            In every list, the left-hand option (Option A) is the Camry Hybrid at $4900 a year, and is identical in all rows. The right-hand option (Option B) is a Camry at some annual leasing cost. This leasing cost decreases as you go down the list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            To make a choice just click on the option you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row), <span style="background-color: yellow;">highlighting your choice yellow. </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing Option A to choosing Option B.</b> You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting Option A in all rows above and Option B in all rows below your selected row.
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on where you switch from Option A to Option B in this list, we will assess how much more you are willing to pay annually to lease the Camry Hybrid as opposed to the Camry. 
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, in the choice list above, you would be willing to pay between ?? and ?? more annually to lease the Cambry Hybrid as opposed to the Camry, because this is where the switching occurs.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between the two leasing options. We will use these decisions to assess how much more you would be willing to pay to lease the Camry Hybrid relative to the Camry. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the best decision you can take, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
   </ul>
