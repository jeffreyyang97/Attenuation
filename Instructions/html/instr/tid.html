    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you will decide between two hypothetical payments.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The <b>“future payment”</b> pays <b>$100 with a specific delay. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>“immediate payment”</b> pays <b>a specific amount now.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        For all hypothetical payments in this part of the study, <b>please treat them as if you know you will receive them with certainty,</b> even if they are delayed. That is, please assume there is no risk that you wouldn’t actually get paid.  
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the <b>delay of the future payment as well as the amount of the immediate payment.</b> You will then decide between the two payments.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the delay of the future payment will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, the delay of the future payment is in 1 year.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether your prefer this delayed payment or a given immediate payment.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will see choice lists such as the one below, where each row is a separate choice.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    </center>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In every list, the right-hand option (Option B) is a delayed payment that is identical in all rows. The left-hand option (Option A) is an immediate payment. The immediate payment increases as you go down the list. 
        </li>
        <li>
            To make a choice just click on the option you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row), <span style="background-color: lightyellow;">highlighting your choice yellow. </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing Option A to choosing Option B.</b> You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting Option A in all rows above and Option B in all rays below your selected row. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on where you switch from Option A to Option B in this list, we assess which immediate payment (Option A) you value as much as the future payment (Option B). 
        </li>
        <li>
            For example, in the choice list above, you would value the future payment as much as an immediate payment between $80 and $100 because this is where switching occurs.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between a future payment and different immediate payments. We will use these decisions to assess how much the delayed payment is worth to you. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect how much you value the delayed payment, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
   </ul>
