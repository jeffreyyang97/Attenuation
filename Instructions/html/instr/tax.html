    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will estimate the income taxes owed by a hypothetical taxpayer named Fred. </b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Fred is a 32-year-old U.S. citizen. Fred is filing his 2023 U.S. Federal Tax Return for income earned over 2023 (filing in spring 2024), claiming a Single filing status with <b>no dependents </b> and <b>claiming the standard deduction.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Fred’s tax computation is particularly simple, since <b>all of his taxable income comes from his annual salary.</b> He has <b> no other sources of taxable income,</b> and is <b>not claiming additional credits, deductions, or exemptions</b> (beyond the standard deduction).
    </li>
    <li>
            In each round, we will ask you to estimate the <b>total federal income tax</b> Fred would have to pay for <b>different levels of his annual salary.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the annual salary of Fred varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this study is selected for payment, you earn $10 if you are within $200 of the correct answer.

    <ul> 
        <li>
            In this example, Fred’s annual salary is $70,000.        
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to estimate how much Fred would have to pay in federal income taxes.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will estimate how much Fred would have to pay in federal income taxes. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your answer. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your answer is actually correct.
       </li>
