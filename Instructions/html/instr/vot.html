    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study <b> you will decide whether or not to submit a vote in an election for option A or option B.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In each round, you <b>start out with a wealth of $10.</b> If <b>option B wins</b> the election, you <b>must pay $8 in taxes</b>, leaving you with $2.   But if <b>option A</b> wins the election, you won’t be taxed and <b>will keep your entire $10</b>. <b>Submitting a vote (for option A) costs you $1</b>.
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are some number of other robot voters in the election. Each robot voter <b>has a 50% chance of randomly voting for A vs. B</b>. You will know how many other voters there are, but you won’t know which way each of them are voting when you make your decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will add up all of the votes for A and B (including yours if you submit one), and <b>declare A the winner if A receives strictly more votes than B.</b> If both get equally many votes, B is the winner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your decision is simply whether to pay $1 to submit a vote for A, or instead to not vote.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The outcome of the election will matter for your earnings, whether or not you decided to vote.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            In each round, you will be told <b>the number of other robot voters.</b> You will then decide <b>whether you would would like to pay $1 to vote for A</b>, or instead not vote.
        </li>
        <li>
            In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of other voters varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will influence your bonus.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, you will start out with $10. You will be taxed $8 if B wins the election and pay $1 if you submitted a vote.

            In this example, the number of other voters is 35.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether to pay $1 to submit a vote for A.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        Would you like to pay $1 to submit a vote for A?
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
    </li>
   </ul>
