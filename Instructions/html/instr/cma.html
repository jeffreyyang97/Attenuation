    <u>Your task:</u>

    <br>
    In this study, you will act as a consumer who only likes milk and juice. <b> Your task is to maximize the consumer’s happiness.</b> The consumer’s overall happiness is given by the following expression, where quantities denote gallons:
<center>
    <div class="formula">
        <b>
            Happiness = sqrt (milk) + sqrt (juice)
        </b>
    </div>
</center>

  <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
            As you can see in the figures, the consumer’s happiness increases in how much milk and juice he drinks. However, <b>each additional gallon of milk or juice is worth less and less</b> to the consumer. For example, while the happiness derived from 10 gallons of milk is higher than the happiness derived from 9 gallons, the happiness boost derived from the additional gallon is much smaller than the happiness boost that results from consuming one gallon versus zero gallons. 

        </li>
        <li>
            The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on milk and juice. Juice always costs $1 a gallon, <b>but the price of milk varies.</b>
         </li>
       
            <li>
                In each round, you <b>will be told the price of milk</b>. You will <b>then decide what share (in percent) of your budget to spend on milk and what share on juice.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also buy fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons of milk.
            </li>
        <li>
            In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of milk varies. <b>These rounds are completely independent from one another.</b> If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, we will calculate the consumer’s happiness as described above. Your bonus then equals     
        <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715; (Consumer’s Happiness / Maximal Happiness)
            </div>
        </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate the share of the budget spent on milk that you think maximizes the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        What share of your budget you spend on milk.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the optimal decision.  When we say “optimal decision”, we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
