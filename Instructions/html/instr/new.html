    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will act as a <b>fictional firm who produces and sells a single product</b>, gallons of cola. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will choose how much fictional cola to produce, between 0 and 100 gallons. You can <b>sell cola at a sales price of $12 per gallon. 
            </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            On the other hand, each gallon will cost you a certain amount to produce.          
        </li>
       
            <li>
                In each round, you will be told how much each gallon costs to produce. You will then decide <b>how many gallons to produce.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                You must decide how many gallons to produce <b>before</b> you know for certain the “demand” quantity: the amount of cola your customers actually want to buy. The computer <b>randomly selects the demand from a range of 1 to 100 gallons</b>, with each number in the range <b>equally likely</b>. That is, there is a 1/100 chance that demand will be 1, a 1/100 chance that demand will be 2, and so on. Gallons that you produce but for which there is no demand go to waste. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <u>This means:  </u>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you produce <b>fewer</b> gallons than there is demand, you sell <b>all gallons that you produced,</b> but you also <b>lose opportunities for sales.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you produce <b>more</b> gallons than there is demand, you sell <b>those gallons that meet the available demand.</b> The remaining gallons that <b>can’t be sold go to waste,</b> and you still need to <b>pay the cost of producing them.</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>
                    The <b>firm’s profit</b> for each decision you take will be equal to the number of gallons you sell times the sales price of $12, minus the cost of producing gallons:
                </li>
                <center>
                    <div class="formula">
                        Firm profit = Gallons sold &#x2715; $12 – Gallons produced &#x2715; Cost of producing each gallon
                    </div>
                </center>
                <li>
                    You can also produce fractions of gallons, such as 6.78 gallons. These result in fractional revenue just like whole gallons do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, <b>the cost of producing cola varies.</b> These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
                </li>
    </ul>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, we will calculate your profit as described above. Your bonus then equals:
            <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 6 + 1/200 &#x2715; Firm profit (or loss)
            </div>
        </center>
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that it is in your best interest to <b>truthfully indicate the amount you want to spend on each product that you think maximizes the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

            In this example, the cost of producing each gallon is $3.        
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how many gallons to produce.

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many gallons you want to produce.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the best decision you can take for yourself, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
