    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>decide whether to participate in a lottery or not. </b>
<ul>
    <li>
        The lottery has two possible outcomes that are <b>equally likely, i.e. it is a 50-50 lottery. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        One lottery outcome is a <b>loss</b>, the other lottery outcome is a <b>gain</b>. If it is a gain, you receive money. If it is a loss, you have to pay money.
    </li>
    <li>
       <b> You have a budget of 00 points</b> where each point is worth $0.10 in payment to you. The outcome of the lottery will be added to that budget if it is a gain, and subtracted from your budget if it is a loss.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide <b>whether or not you want to accept the lottery</b> (have it played out for you to influence your payment), or reject it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prior to making your decision, you can actually <b>find out what the randomly drawn lottery outcome is.</b> You can do so by verifying the correctness of math equations that will be shown to you on your screen. Specifically, 60 addition equations will be shown to you. Each equation is either correct, such as 60+29=89, or incorrect, such as 17+28=41.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>35</b> equations are <b>correct</b> and <b>25</b> are <b>incorrect</b>, the lottery outcome is a <b>gain</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>25</b> equations are <b>correct</b> and <b>35</b> are <b>incorrect</b>, the lottery outcome is a <b>loss</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li> 
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told the two possible outcomes of the lottery, and 60 equations will be shown to you. You will then decide whether to accept or reject the lottery.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the outcomes of the lottery will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions  may affect your bonus. If a round in this study is selected for payment each point is worth $0.10.  You will receive your budget of 100 points if you rejected the lottery. If you accepted the lottery, you will receive the sum of the budget and the lottery outcome:  
    <ul>
        <li>
            If the lottery outcome is a <b>gain</b>, your bonus will be <b>larger</b> than the budget. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the lottery outcome is a <b>loss</b>, you bonus will be <b>smaller</b> than the budget. 
        </li>
    </ul>

            In this example, the possible lottery outcomes are a 63 point gain and a 37 point loss.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide whether to accept or reject the lottery.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide to accept or reject the lottery. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
