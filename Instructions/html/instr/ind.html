    In this study, <b>the computer will flip a digital coin which may land on Heads or Tails.</b>
    <center>
        <div style = "background-color: #F5F5F5; background: ghostwhite; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid lightgray;  display: inline-block; text-align: left; margin: 10px;">
            With <b>50%</b> chance: <b>Heads</b>

        </div>
    </center>
    <ul>
    <li>
        If this study is selected for bonus payment, you will guess whether the coin landed Heads or Tails. If your guess is correct, you will be paid a <b>$5 bonus.  </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You will have the chance <b>to obtain information that may help you make an informed guess about the coin flip.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The information comes in the form of a <b>hint</b>, such as “The coin came up Heads.” 
        </li>
        <li>
            The hint is not always correct but instead has an <b>accuracy rate</b>: the percent chance that the hint correctly states the outcome of the coin flip. 
        </li>
        <li>
            This accuracy rate is always between 50% and 100%.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If it is <b>50%,</b> the hint is <b>equally likely to be right and wrong.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it is <b>100%,</b> the hint is <b>always correct.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it is greater than 50% but less than 100%, the hint is <b>more likely to be right than wrong.</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
            In each round, we will <b>tell you what the accuracy rate of the hint is.</b> You will then indicate how much you would at most be willing to pay, out of a budget of $5, to actually receive the hint. As explained in greater detail below, the more you are willing to pay, the more likely it is that you actually receive the hint in the event that round is selected for payment.
    </li>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the accuracy rate of the hint varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. If a round in this study is selected for payment, you will be asked to guess the coin flip for a $5 bonus. 
    Prior to making your guess, you may receive a hint, depending on how much you indicate you are willing to pay for it.  This works as follows:
    
     
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will be given a budget of $5, and the computer will randomly select a price between $0 and $5. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the price selected by the computer is lower than your stated willingness to pay for the hint, you will receive the hint, and the price selected by the computer will be subtracted from your budget. Then, your bonus payment will be your remaining budget plus $5 or $0, depending on whether you are able to correctly guess the side the coin landed on. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the price selected by the computer is higher than your stated willingness to pay for the hint, you will not receive the hint. Then, your bonus payment will be your budget plus $5 or $0, depending on whether you are able to correctly guess the side the coin landed on.
        </li>
        <li>
            This procedure may seem complicated, but all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate how much you would at most pay for the hint, and to make you best guess whether the coin came up Heads or Tails.</b>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>
            In this example, the hint has an accuracy rate of 70%. This means that if the coin flip landed on Heads, there is a 70% chance the hint will correctly say Heads, and if the coin flip landed Tails, there is a 70% chance the hint will correctly say Tails.
        </li>
        <li>
            You would then indicate how much you would at most be willing to pay for the hint.
        </li>
        <li>
            If this task is selected for payment, the computer will determine whether you receive the hint, following the procedure described above.  You would then state your guess whether the coin came up Heads or Tails.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide how much you are willing to pay for the hint. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decision actually reflects how much you value the hint, given your personal preferences and the available information.
