    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
        In this part of the study, <b>you will be asked to evaluate a hypothetical policy.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        In a bipartisan effort, Democrats and Republicans cobbled together <b>a new bill to invest $1 billion into cancer research. No new taxes need to be raised;</b> instead, the money would be diverted away from other expenditure categories.
    </li>
    <li>
        Politicians agree that this is, in principle, <b>a very useful spending bill,</b> and that it would <b>be a better investment than the other expenditure categories the money is currently being used for</b>. Overall, happiness researchers and politicians from across the aisle estimate that spending the money on cancer research would be more effective in making Americans happy, compared to alternative uses of the funds.
    </li>
    <li>
        However, administering the spending bill would require <b>setting up a new administrative structure that would eat up some of the $1 billion funding.</b> Thus, from a taxpayerâ€™s perspective, <b>some</b> fraction of the money <b>would go to waste.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell you <b>what fraction of the funding would get lost.</b> You will then be asked to indicate how much you would support the policy (on a scale from 0 to 100). If the bill does not pass, the available funding continues to be used for other expenditure categories that are deemed less effective.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also indicate your support (on a scale from 0 to 100) in fractions, such as 6.78.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the fraction of the funding that is lost varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>
</ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, 50% of the funding would be lost.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to indicate your support for the policy.
        </li>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much you would support the spending bill.
    </li> 
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
