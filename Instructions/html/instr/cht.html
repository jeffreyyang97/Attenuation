<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you will <b>estimate the quality of a hypothetical financial investment product after getting advice from your financial advisor, who might be paid to make you overestimate the investment’s quality.</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                
                The investment product’s quality is determined by the computer. Specifically, the computer <b>randomly selects a number between 0 and 100 with equal probability</b>. However, you will not see which quality was selected. Instead, you need to estimate it. You receive more money the more accurate your estimate, i.e. <b>the closer your estimate to the actual investment quality. </b>

            </li>
            <li>
                	Before making your estimate, you will receive a message from your financial advisor. Your financial advisor is another participant who was randomly matched to you. The financial advisor does not estimate the investment quality like you do. Rather, the financial advisor knows the investment quality and then chooses which number to report to you. <b>Your advisor can report the actual investment quality to you, but they can also lie.</b> Your advisor’s bonus depends on the estimate you make. 

            </li>
            <li>
                There are <b>two types of financial advisors</b> who are paid in different ways.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            Unbiased Advisor: 
                        </b>
                        This advisor is paid the same way as you. Just like your bonus, their bonus is determined by how accurate your estimate is (how close your guess is to the actual investment quality).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            Biased Advisor: 
                        </b>
                        This advisor is paid more the higher your estimate is, independent of what the true investment quality is.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                </li>

            <li>
                You will be told how many of the 100 advisors are Biased and how many are Unbiased. However, <b>you will not be told whether the Advisor you have been matched with is actually Biased or Unbiased.</b>

            <li>
               <b> In each round, you will be told how many Biased and Unbiased Advisors there are in total, and which number your matched Advisor reports to you. Then you will make your estimate of the investment quality. </b>

                When choosing which number to report to you, your advisor knows that you know how many Biased and Unbiased Advisors there are.

            <li>
                In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Biased and Unbiased Advisors will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

            In this example, there are 70 Biased and 30 Unbiased Advisors. Your randomly selected advisor decided to report to you that the investment quality is 74.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then then make your estimate by picking a number between 0 and 100.

       <li>
        You will estimate the investment’s quality.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible decision given the information available to you.
