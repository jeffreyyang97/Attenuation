    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you will distribute points between other participants, that will determine their payments. </b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        You will be given <b>100 points</b> and be matched into a group with
        <ul>
            <li>
                another participant called the <b>Receiver</b>, who starts with <b>0 points</b>, and 
            </li>
            <li>
                some number of other participants called <b>Payers</b>, who each start off <b> with 100 points</b>.   
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Every point in the experiment is <b>worth 10 cent</b> in bonus earnings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide how many points to award to the Receiver.  Every point you award to the Receiver will result in 1 point being subtracted from each of the Payers. However, your points will not be affected at all by your decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>how many Payers there are.</b>  You will then decide <b>how many points to award to the Receiver (and subtract from each of the Payers).</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also send fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of Payers varies.  These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect the bonus payment of other participants in your group.  Everyone in your group is making <b>the same decisions</b> as you are.  If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the computer will <b>randomly decide who in the group is assigned to be the Receiver, who are assigned to be Payers, and whose decision is assigned to “count”</b> to determine the earnings of the other participants assigned to be Receivers and Payers.  If your decision is the one that counts, you will <b>earn 100 points for sure</b> and your decisions will <b>only affect the Receivers and Payers in your group.</b>    Since your decision only matters if you are selected to decide, it is best to make this decision as if you know for sure that you are the person whose decision counts.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points you would like to give to the Receiver and subtract from each of the Payers.    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are (in percentage terms) that the decision you made reflects the best decision you can take, given your personal preferences and the available information.
       </li>
   </ul>
