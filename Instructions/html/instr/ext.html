    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, <b>you will choose between receiving money for yourself and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.</b> There are always two options: Option A and Option B. 
    <ul>
    <li>
        Option A gives you a<b> monetary payment. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
       <b>Option B does not give you a monetary payment,</b> but <b>choosing Option B reduces the amount of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.</b> Specifically, we will actually implement these reductions in emissions by purchasing carbon offsets. Carbon offsets work by funding real projects that lower CO2 emissions 
       <div class="tooltip_ext">
        (Hover here for more information on carbon offsets).
        <span class="tooltiptext">
            Carbon offsets are tradable “rights” or certificates linked to activities that lower the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. By buying these certificates, a person or group can fund projects that fight climate change, instead of taking actions to lower their own carbon emissions. 
    
            Carbon offsets fund specific projects that either lower CO2 emissions, or “sequester” CO2, meaning they take some CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it. Some common examples of projects include reforestation, building renewable energy, carbon-storing agricultural practices, and waste and landfill management. Reforestation in particular is one of the most popular types of projects to produce carbon offsets. Carbon offsets are granted to project owners, who sell them to third parties like companies that want to balance the CO2 they put into the atmosphere by paying to remove CO2 from somewhere else.
        </span>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be <b>told the amount of CO2 emissions reduced by choosing Option B</b>. You will then decide between the two options. You will make this decision <b>for a range of different amounts of money paid by Option A</b>. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the amount of CO2 emissions reduced by choosing Option B varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
</ul>

<u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this study may affect your bonus and the reduction of CO2 emissions. If a round in this study is selected for payment, the computer will randomly select one of your choices.
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you chose Option A, you will receive the monetary payment provided by that option. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If you chose Option B, we will purchase carbon offsets that equal the amount of CO2 emissions reduced by that option. We will purchase these offsets from the United Nations Carbon Offset Platform, which certifies carbon reduction projects (click

            for more information on the UN Carbon Offset Platform).
        </li>
    </ul> 
    This means that it is in your best interest <b>to choose the option you actually prefer in each case.</b>

    <ul> 
        <li>
            In this example, the amount of CO2 emissions reduced by choosing Option B is 15 kilograms. 
        </li>
        <li>
            You will then decide between reducing CO2 emissions and receive a monetary payment.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will make your decisions in a choice list, <b>where each row is a separate choice.</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In every list, the left-hand is a reduction of CO2 emissions that is identical in all rows The right-hand option gives you a monetary gain. This monetary gain increases from row-to-row as you go down the list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make a choice just click on the radio button you prefer for each choice (i.e. for each row).
                </li>    
                <li>
                    <b>An effective way to complete these choice lists is to determine in which row you would prefer to switch from choosing the CO2 reduction to choosing a monetary gain.</b> 
                    You can click on that row and we will automatically fill out the rest of the list for you, by selecting the CO2 reduction in all rows above and the monetary gain in all rows below your selected row.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Based on where you switch from reducing carbon emissions to gaining money in this list, we assess which monetary gain you value as much as reducing a certain amount of CO2 emissions.
                </li>   
                <li>
                    For example, in the choice list above, your choice suggests that you value reducing CO2 emissions by 50 kilograms as much as a monetary gain between $9.00 and $10.00, because this is where switching occurs.
                </li>
            </ul>

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will decide between Option A and Option B. We will use these decisions to assess which monetary gain you value as much as a given reduction in CO2 emissions. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect how much you value the reduction in CO2 emissions, given your personal preferences and the available information.
