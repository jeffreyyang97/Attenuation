    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>you have to estimate the stock price of a fictional company. </b>   
    <ul>
    <li>
        The stock price is determined by the number of good and bad pieces of news about the company.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, there are 100 pieces of news about each company. The stock price is determined by the following formula:
        <center>
            <div class="formula_li" style="font-weight: bold;">
                Stock price (in $)= 100 + <!-- 10 &#x2715;--> number of positive news â€“ <!--10 &#x2715; -->number of negative news
            </div>
        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told shown <b>the number of positive and negative news. </b> Specifically, you will see <b>100 images</b>, some of which represent <b>positive news and some of which negative news.</b> 
    </li>
    <li>
        Based on your estimate of how many positive images and how many negative images there are, you will then estimate the stock price.
    </li>
    <li>
        This part of the study has two sections. You will complete 6 rounds of the task in the first section, where each round is about a different company. <b>These firms are completely independent from one another. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Across these rounds, <b>the number of pieces of positive and negative news received will vary. </b> 
    </li>
    <li>
        In the second section of the task, there will be another 6 rounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus. 
    </li>
    
    </ul>

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. 
    If a round in the first or second section of this part is selected for payment, you will recieve $10 
    if your answer is within +/- $5 of the correct stock price, and nothing otherwise.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will make your estimate of the stock price. 
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your estimate. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your estimate is actually correct.
       </li>
   </ul>
