    In this study, you will act as a consumer who only consumes milk and juice. Your task is <b>to maximize the consumer’s overall happiness by deciding how much juice and milk to buy</b>.

<ul>
    <li> 
        The consumer’s overall happiness is given by the square root of the amount of milk consumed plus the square root of the amount of juice consumed, where amounts are measured in bottles:
    <center>
    <div class="formula">
        <b>Overall happiness = 
            <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                <span style="font-size: 24px;">&radic;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Bottles of milk&nbsp;</span>
            </span> + 
                 <span style="white-space: nowrap">
                    <span style="font-size: 24px;">&radic;</span><span style="text-decoration:overline">&nbsp;Bottles of juice&nbsp;</span>
                </span>
        </b>

    </div>
</center>
<br>
Here’s how the amount of milk and juice consumed translate into happiness:

            <b>
                Happiness from juice =   <span style="white-space: nowrap">

  <li>
    As you can see in the figures, the <b>consumer’s happiness increases in how much milk and juice s/he drinks.</b> However, <b>each additional bottle of milk or juice produces less and less additional happiness.</b> For example, while the happiness derived from 100 bottles of milk is higher than the happiness derived from 99 bottles, the happiness <b>increase</b> resulting from the additional bottle is much smaller than the happiness <b>increase</b> that results from consuming one bottle instead of zero bottles. 
  </li>
  <li>
            The consumer has a total budget of $100 to spend on milk and juice. You need to spend your entire budget in each round. 
        </li>

            <li>
        Juice always costs $1 a bottle, <b>but the price of milk varies.</b>        
         </li>
<li>
    To keep things simple, we will ask you <b>what fraction of the bottles you buy are milk</b>, and then the computer will automatically and instantly display for you how many bottles of milk/juice you would get with the given prices. 
    The computer will also instantly display for you how much you would spend on milk/juice. 
</li>
<li>
    In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the cost of milk varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
       

    Your decisions may affect your bonus payment. 
    If a decision in this study is selected for payment, 
    you will receive $10 if your answer is within +/-1% of the fraction of bottles which are milk 
    that maximizes the consumer's overall happiness at the prevailing prices, and nothing otherwise.

    

    <!--

        Your decisions  may affect your bonus payment. 
    If a decision in this study is selected for payment, 
    we will calculate the consumer’s overall happiness as described above
    <center>
            <div class="formula">
                Bonus (in $) = 10  &#x2715; (Consumer’s overall happiness / Maximal overall happiness)&#178;
            </div>
        </center>
    where by "maximal overall happiness" we mean the consumer's overall happiness if he bought those amounts of milk and juice that actually maximize his overall happiness at the prevailing prices.
    While this may sound complicated, all it means is that <b>it is in your best interest to truthfully indicate the amounts of milk and juice that you think maximize the consumer’s overall happiness.</b>

        <li>
            You then need to decide what fraction of the bottles you buy are milk. Based on your decision, the computer will instantly calculate how much milk and juice you would get, given the prices and your total budget.

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
       <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        What fraction of the bottles you buy are milk.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually the optimal decision, by which we mean the decision that maximizes your bonus.
