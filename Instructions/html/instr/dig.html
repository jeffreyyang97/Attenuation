    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be given 100 points. At the end of the study, you will be paid $0.10 for each point you have.  
    <ul>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide <b>how many of those points to send to another participant in the study.</b> This other participant <b>starts out with 0 points,</b> and they will also be paid 10 cents for each point they have at the end of the study.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is, however, some <b>percentage chance</b>, between 0% and 100%, that <b>whatever points you decide to send to the other participant will disappear, and never be received by the other participant (or yourself).</b> This means that, with some percentage chance, the points you send will go to waste. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round you will be told <b>the percentage chance that the money you send will disappear.</b>  You will then decide how many points to send to the other participant.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also send fractions of points, such as 6.7 points.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the percentage chance that money you send will disappear varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your (and the other participantâ€™s) bonus.
    </li>
</ul>

Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment and the bonus payment of another participant.  If a decision in this part is selected for payment you will be paid 10 cents for each point you keep and the other participant 10 cents for each point they receive.

            In this example, the percentage change that money you send disappears is 50%.

        <li>
            You then need to decide how many points to send to the other participant.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    
   <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How many points you want to send to another participant.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.   
    </li>
   </ul>
