    <br>
        In this study, , we will describe a hypothetical scenario in which some number of people are expected to be sick for one month due to a new disease. <b>You will decide how much money you think the government should spend on curing the disease.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        	In each round, you will be told <b>how many people are expected to be sick for a month due to the disease</b>. During their sickness, people cannot work and are generally heavily constrained in their activities. There are no secondary damages of the disease. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to decide <b>how much money, between $0 and $1 million, the government should be willing to spend</b> to cure the disease, preventing people from being sick.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the number of people expected to suffer from the disease varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        	How many dollars you think the government should be willing to spend. 
        </li> 
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
