<h2>
    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this study, you act as a financial advisor <b>who can give advice to a customer on the quality of a hypothetical financial investment product. You are paid more the higher the customer evaluates the investment product’s quality.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                
                The investment product’s quality is determined by the computer. Specifically, the computer <b>selects a number between 0 and 20.</b> You will see which quality was selected. 

            </li>
            <li>
                	
                Your customer is another participant who was randomly matched to you. Your customer <b>does not see the investment quality.</b> Instead, they need to estimate it. Both yours and your customer’s earnings depend on your customer’s estimate. However, you are paid in different ways:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        
                            <b>Your customer receives more money the more accurate their estimate,</b> i.e. the closer their estimate is to the actual investment quality.  
                        
                       
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            You (the advisor) receive more money the higher your customer’s estimate,   
                          </b>
                          independent of what the true investment quality is.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                </li>
                <li>
                    This means: you get a higher bonus if the other participant’s estimate is higher.
                </li>

                In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the investment product’s quality will vary. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.
