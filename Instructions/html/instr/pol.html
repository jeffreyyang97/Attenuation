    <u>Your task:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
        In this study, <b>you will be asked to evaluate a hypothetical policy.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        In a bipartisan effort, Democrats and Republicans cobbled together a new bill that would <b>increase the income of each household in the U.S. next year by $10,000.</b> If the bill is not passed, incomes do not increase. 
    </li>
    <li>
        However, the bill would also <b>lead to inflation next year</b>. The prices of all goods, including groceries and gas, would increase. The estimates of how much prices would increase vary.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell you how much inflation there would be. You will then be asked to indicate <b>how much you would support the policy</b> (on a scale from 0 to 100). 
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 11 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the degree of inflation varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>
</ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            In this example, inflation would be 4%.
        </li>
        <li>
        	You then need to indicate your support for the policy.

<h2>
   <u>Your certainty:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        	How much you would support the policy.    </li> 
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decision. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that the decision you made is actually your best decision, given your personal preferences and the available information.
    </li>
   </ul>
