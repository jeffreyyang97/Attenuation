    <br>
    	In this study, <b>you will participate in a guessing game with another participant.</b> This game works as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>
        Each player secretly and independently guesses a number between 0 and 100.
    </li>
    <li>
        The goal of each player is <b>to make a guess that is as close as possible</b> to their so-called <b>target.</b> The tricky part of this game is that <b>each participant’s target depends on the other participant’s guess.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your target is given by the other participant’s guess, multiplied by a certain number that we will call your <b>MULTIPLIER</b>:
            <center>
                <div class="formula_li">
                    	<b>Your target = Other participant’s guess &#x2715; 1</b>
                </div>
            </center>
        </li>
        <li>
            The other participant’s target is given by your guess, multiplied by 1:
            <center>
                <div class="formula_li">
                    	<b>Other participant’s target = Your guess &#x2715; MULTIPLIER</b>
                </div>
            </center>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, if the other participant guesses 20, then you would maximize your bonus by guessing as closely as possible to 20 &#x2715; 1 = 20. However, when you make your own guess, you will not know what the other participant’s guess is. Likewise, when the other participant makes their guess they will not know what your guess is.
    </li>
    <li>
        	At the decision screen, you (and the other participant) will be told the MULTIPLER. You will then each make a guess, which will determine your payment according to the payoff formula described below.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    You will earn a larger bonus the closer your guess is to the target, up to a maximum of $10. Specifically, your bonus will be equal to 

    
    <center>
        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = $10 – 1/10 &#x2715; (Distance between your guess and your target)
        </div>
    </center>
    This means: <b>you maximize your bonus by guessing as closely as possible to your target.</b>
    <br>
    The other participant’s bonus will be determined in the same way: their bonus will be equal to $10 – 1/10 x (Distance between their guess and their target).

   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will guess a number.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your guess. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible guess, given the information you have.
    </li>
   </ul>
