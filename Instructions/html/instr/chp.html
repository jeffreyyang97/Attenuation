    <br>
    In this study, you act as a customer who receives information <b>on the quality of a hypothetical financial product</b> and has to decide <b>what is the true quality of the product.</b> <b> You are paid more the more accurate your guess for the true investment product’s quality is.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                
                The investment product’s quality is determined by the computer. Specifically, the computer <b>selects a number between 0 and 20.</b> 

            </li>
            <li>
                	
                There is a financial advisor.  The financial advisor is another participant who was randomly matched to you. Your financial advisors <b>sees the investment quality.</b>  Both yours and your the financial advisor's earnings depend on your  estimate for the quality. However, you are paid in different ways:

                <ul>
                     <li>
                        <b>
                            The financial advisor receives more money the higher you estimate the financial product’s quality,   
                          </b>
                          independent of what the true investment quality is.

                    <li>
                        
                            <b>You (the customer) receive more money the more accurate your estimate,</b> i.e. the closer your estimate is to the actual investment quality.
