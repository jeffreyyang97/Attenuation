    <br>
        In this study, <b>you will make a series of hypothetical decisions about how much you would be willing to pay for a specific quantity of a given product.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        Imagine that you are <b>given a budget of $30</b>. You will then see <b>a description of the product and the quantity you would receive. </b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Your task is to indicate the <b>precise dollar amount (between $0 and $30) that you would at most be willing to pay.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Imagine that these items would be shipped to your home address without any additional shipping costs, and that you get to keep whatever amount of the $30 you donâ€™t spend.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be told <b>what the product is and which quantity is for sale.</b> You will then decide how much <b> you would at most be willing to pay</b> by indicating a dollar amount.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can also enter digits, such as $6.78.
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the quantity of the product that is for sale varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another.

            In this example, you evaluate 4 packs of organic penne.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to decide how much you would at most be willing to pay for this product.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        How much would you at most be willing to pay. We will use this answer to determine how much you value the product.   
     </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your decisions. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your decisions actually reflect how much you value the product, given your personal preferences.
    </li>
