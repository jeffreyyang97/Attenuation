    <u>Your task:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    In this part of the study, you will be asked 
<b>to forecast the total growth of the U.S. stock market over different time horizons.</b><ul>
    <li>
        By “U.S. stock market” we mean the S&P 500 index that calculates the average stock market performance of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S.
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, we will tell <b>you what the time horizon is.</b> You will then be asked to forecast total stock market growth (in percent) over this horizon. 
    </li>

    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these rounds, the time horizon varies. These rounds are completely independent from one another. 
    </li>

            In this example, the time horizon is 1 year.
        </li>
        <li>
            You then need to forecast total stock market growth over the next year.

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
    <li>
        Your forecast of stock market growth.
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are about your forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that yours is actually the best possible forecast, given the information you have today.   
    </li>
   </ul>
