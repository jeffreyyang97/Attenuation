    <br>
    In this part of the study, <b>your task is to forecast the future stock price growth of several fictional firms, based on the current earnings of each firm.</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
        There are <b>two types</b> of firms: <b>good</b> firms and <b>bad</b> <b>firms</b>. Good firms have an <b>average stock price growth of</b> <b>$50</b>, while <b>bad firms have an average stock price growth of $10.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Because these numbers are averages, it is possible for a firm to deliver a stock price growth above or below the average.
        </li>
        <li>
            The graphic below plots the likelihood of each level of stock price growth for the two types of firms:
        </li>

        </center>
    </li>
    <li>
        Each firm you forecast <b>will be randomly drawn from the population of firms in an industry.</b> There are an <b>equal number of good and bad firms in each industry.</b> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>You will not observe whether a firm is good or bad.</b> However, you will observe the <b>current earnings of the firm,</b> which may be informative about its type. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            The current earnings of a firm can either be high or low. A good firm is more likely than not to have high current earnings, and a bad firm is more likely than not to have low current earnings.
        </li>
        <li>
            The exact probability that each type of firm has high vs. low earnings depends on the firm's industry. For each firm you forecast, you will be told these probabilities.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        The future stock price growh of a firm depends only on its current earnings to the extent that the firm’s current earnings is informative about whether it is a good or bad firm. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In each round, you will be given a firm in a different industry to forecast. You will be told <b>the current earnings of that firm, as well as the probabilities that good vs. bad firms in that industry have high vs. low earnings.</b> Your task is to <b>forecast the stock price growth of the firm.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        In total, you will complete 13 rounds of this task. Across these round, the industry of the firm you forecast will vary. These rounds are completely independent from one another. If one of the rounds of this task is selected to determine your bonus, only your decision in this one round will determine your bonus.

        <u>Your bonus payment:</u>
</h2>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <br>
    Your decisions in this part of the study may affect your bonus payment. For each round, there will be a statistically correct forecast of the stock price growth of the firm. If a decision in this part is selected for payment, the maximum bonus you can earn is $10. The closer your decision is to the statistical correct answer, the higher your bonus will be: 
    <center>
        <div class="formula">
            Bonus (in $) = 10 – 1/90  &#x2715; (Your decision – correct answer)  &#x2715; (Your decision – correct answer)
        </div>
    </center>
    While this may look complicated, all it means is that you maximize your bonus by <b>truthfully telling us which probability is closest to the correct answer. </b>

   <u>Your certainty:</u>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
   <br>
   In each round, we will ask you two questions:
    <br>
   <ul>
       <li>
        You will forecast the stock price growth of the firm.     
    </li>
       <li>
        We will ask you <b>how certain</b> you are that your forecast is actually the statistically correct forecast. Specifically, we are interested in how likely you think it is (in percentage terms) that your forecast is statistically correct.   
    </li>
